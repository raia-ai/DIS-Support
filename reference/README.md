## Reference Materials

This section contains supplementary reference materials that support the broader DIS Corporation documentation ecosystem. These resources do not fit neatly into the product-specific categories but provide valuable context and guidance for support staff, administrators, and end users.

The primary resource in this section is the **Product Knowledge Base**, a structured troubleshooting guide derived from an analysis of historical Salesforce support cases. This document focuses on recurring, high-impact issues across the DIS product portfolio and follows a consistent structure for each topic: Problem, Symptoms, Root Causes, Resolution Steps, Validation, Prevention, and Escalation. All personally identifiable information has been removed to ensure privacy and compliance. This knowledge base is designed to enable rapid diagnosis and resolution of common issues while minimizing risk to production systems.
