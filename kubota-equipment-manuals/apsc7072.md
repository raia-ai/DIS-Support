## Important Safety Information
Listed below are common practices that may or may not be applicable to the products described in this manual.

### Look for the Safety Alert Symbol
The SAFETY ALERT SYMBOL indicates there is a potential hazard to personal safety involved and extra safety precaution must be taken. When you see this symbol, be alert and carefully read the message that follows it. In addition to design and configuration of equipment, hazard control, and accident prevention are dependent upon the awareness, concern, prudence, and proper training of personnel involved in the operation, transport, maintenance, and storage of equipment.

### Be Aware of Signal Words
A signal word designates a degree or level of hazard seriousness. The signal words are:
> **DANGER**: Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury.
>
> **WARNING**: Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury.
>
> **CAUTION**: Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, may result in minor or moderate injury.

### Safety at All Times
Careful operation is your best assurance against an accident. All operators, no matter how much experience they may have, should carefully read this manual and other related manuals, or have the manuals read to them, before operating the power machine and this attachment.

*   Thoroughly read and understand the "Safety Label" section. Read all instructions noted on them.
*   Do not operate the equipment while under the influence of drugs or alcohol as they impair the ability to safely and properly operate the equipment.
*   Operator should be familiar with all functions of the skid steer and attachment and be able to handle emergencies quickly.
*   Make sure all guards and shields appropriate for the operation are in place and secured before operating the attachment.
*   Keep all bystanders away from equipment and work area.
*   Start skid steer from the driver's seat with steering levers and hydraulic controls in neutral.
*   Operate skid steer and controls from the driver's seat only.
*   Never dismount from a moving skid steer or leave skid steer unattended with engine running.
*   Do not allow anyone to stand between attachment and skid steer while hooking-up.
*   Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.
*   While transporting and operating equipment, watch out for objects overhead and along side such as fences, trees, buildings, wires, etc.
*   Store attachment in an area where children normally do not play. When needed, secure attachment against falling with support blocks.

### Safety Precautions for Children
Tragedy can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children generally are attracted to attachments and their work.
*   Never assume children will remain where you last saw them.
*   Keep children out of the work area and under the watchful eye of a responsible adult.
*   Be alert and shut the attachment and skid steer/track loader down if children enter the work area.
*   Never carry children on the power machine or attachment. There is not a safe place for them to ride. They may fall off and be run over or interfere with the control of the power machine.
*   Never allow children to operate the power machine, even under adult supervision.
*   Never allow children to play on the power machine or attachment.
*   Use extra caution when backing up. Before the power machine starts to move, look down and behind to make sure the area is clear.

### Skid Steer Shutdown And Storage
*   Reduce engine speed and shut-off all power to the attachment.
*   Park on solid, level ground and lower attachment until it is flat on the ground or support blocks.
*   Turn off engine, and remove switch key to prevent unauthorized starting.
*   Relieve all hydraulic pressures.
*   If included, raise seat bar and move controls until both lock.
*   Wait for all components to stop before leaving operator's seat.
*   Use steps, grab-handles and anti-slip surfaces when stepping on and off the skid steer.
*   Detach and store attachment in an area where children normally do not play. Secure attachment by using blocks and supports.

### Tire Safety
*   Tire changing can be dangerous and must be performed by trained personnel using the correct tools and equipment.
*   Always maintain correct tire pressure. Do not inflate tires above recommended pressures shown in the Operator's Manual.
*   When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.
*   Securely support the attachment when changing a wheel.
*   When removing and installing wheels, use wheel handling equipment adequate for the weight involved.
*   Make sure wheel bolts have been tightened to the specified torque.

### Transport Safely
*   Comply with federal, state, and local laws.
*   Use towing vehicle and trailer of adequate size and capacity. Secure equipment towed on a trailer with chocks, tie downs, and chains.
*   Sudden braking can cause a towed trailer to swerve and upset. Reduce speed if towed trailer is not equipped with brakes.
*   Avoid contact with any overhead utility lines or electrically charged conductors.
*   Always drive with load on end of loader arms low to the ground.
*   Always drive straight up and down steep inclines with heavy end of skid steer on the "uphill" side.
*   Engage park brake when stopped on an incline.
*   Maximum transport speed for an attached equipment is 20 mph. DO NOT EXCEED. Never travel at a speed which does not allow adequate control of steering and stopping. Some rough terrains require a slower speed.
*   As a guideline, use the following maximum speed weight ratios for attached equipment:
    *   20 mph when weight of attached equipment is less than or equal to the weight of machine towing the equipment.
    *   10 mph when weight of attached equipment exceeds weight of machine towing equipment but not more than double the weight.
> **IMPORTANT**: Do not tow a load that is more than double the weight of the vehicle towing the load.

### Dig Safe - Avoid Underground Utilities
*   USA: Call 811
*   CAN: digsafecanada.ca
*   Always contact your local utility companies (electrical, telephone, gas, water, sewer, and others) before digging so that they may mark the location of any underground services in the area.
*   Be sure to ask how close you can work to the marks they positioned.

### Practice Safe Maintenance
*   Understand procedure before doing work. Refer to the Operator's Manual for additional information.
*   Work on a level surface in a clean dry area that is well-lit.
*   Lower attachment to the ground and follow all shutdown procedures before leaving the operator's seat to perform maintenance.
*   Do not work under any hydraulic supported equipment. It can settle, suddenly leak down, or be lowered accidentally. If it is necessary to work under the equipment, securely support it with stands or suitable blocking beforehand.
*   Use properly grounded electrical outlets and tools.
*   Use correct tools and equipment for the job that are in good condition.
*   Allow equipment to cool before working on it.
*   Disconnect battery ground cable (-) before servicing or adjusting electrical systems or before welding on equipment.
*   Inspect all parts. Make certain parts are in good condition & installed properly.
*   Replace parts on this attachment with genuine Kubota parts only. Do not alter this attachment in a way which will adversely affect its performance.
*   Do not grease or oil attachment while it is in operation.
*   Remove buildup of grease, oil, or debris.
*   Always make sure any material and waste products from the repair and maintenance of the attachment are properly collected and disposed.
*   Remove all tools and unused parts from the equipment before operation.

### Prepare for Emergencies
*   Be prepared if a fire starts.
*   Keep a first aid kit and fire extinguisher handy.
*   Keep emergency numbers for doctor, ambulance, hospital, and fire department near phone.

### Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
*   Wear protective clothing and equipment appropriate for the job such as safety shoes, safety glasses, hard hat, and ear plugs.
*   Clothing should fit snug without fringes and pull strings to avoid entanglement with moving parts.
*   Prolonged exposure to loud noise can cause hearing impairment or hearing loss. Wear suitable hearing protection such as earmuffs or earplugs.
*   Operating equipment safely requires the operator's full attention. Avoid wearing headphones while operating equipment.

### Avoid High Pressure Fluids Hazard
*   Escaping fluid under pressure can penetrate the skin causing serious injury.
*   Relieve all residual pressure before disconnecting hydraulic lines or performing work on the hydraulic system.
*   Make sure all hydraulic fluid connections are tight and all hydraulic hoses and lines are in good condition before applying pressure to the system.
*   Use a piece of paper or cardboard, NOT BODY PARTS, to check for suspected leaks.
*   Wear protective gloves and safety glasses or goggles when working with hydraulic systems.
*   DO NOT DELAY. If an accident occurs, see a doctor familiar with this type of injury immediately. Any fluid injected into the skin or eyes must be treated within a few hours or gangrene may result.

### Use Safety Lights and Devices
*   Slow moving tractors, skid steers, and self-propelled machines can create a hazard when driven on public roads. They are difficult to see, especially at night. Use the Slow Moving Vehicle (SMV) sign when on public roads.
*   Flashing warning lights and turn signals are recommended whenever driving on public roads.

### Use Seat Belt and ROPS
*   Kubota recommends the use of a CAB or roll-over-protective-structures (ROPS) and seat belt in almost all power machines. Combination of a CAB or ROPS and seat belt will reduce the risk of serious injury or death if the power machine should be upset.
*   If ROPS is in the locked-up position, fasten seat belt snugly and securely to help protect against serious injury or death from falling and machine overturn.

### Keep Riders Off Machinery
*   Never carry riders on skid steer or attachment.
*   Riders obstruct operator's view and interfere with the control of the power machine.
*   Riders can be struck by objects or thrown from the equipment.
*   Never use skid steer or attachment to lift or transport riders.

## Introduction

Kubota welcomes you to the growing family of new product owners. This Skid Cutter has been designed with care and built by skilled workers using quality materials. Proper assembly, maintenance, and safe operating practices will help you get years of satisfactory use from this product.

### Application
SC7072 construction-grade Skid Cutter is designed with the commercial or high use consumer in mind. It features a rigid hitch mounting system, 1/4" thick deck, 4 swinging blades, and a bi-fold door on the front. The SC7072 is capable of cutting and shredding brush or trees up to 7" in diameter. Carbide mulching teeth mounted on the bottom of the blade carrier can be used for grinding stumps. The strong push bars on top and under the door of the SC7072 Skid Cutter allow the operator to push trees and brush over and away from the operator as they are being cut without damaging the unit. The ability to cut and mulch trees and stumps level to the ground makes this cutter ideal for clearing right-of-ways along road sides, pipelines or under electrical transmission lines with the speed and efficiency needed by today's contractors. Farmers, ranchers and land developers will also benefit from this unit when clearing pastures or new development areas. The SC7072 Skid Cutter utilizes the power, compact size, and the go anywhere ability of a SVL to access over grown areas where a tractor and rotary cutter cannot go. The wide, full-length tapered skid shoes prevent the cutter from digging in or getting hung up in the soft ground usually found under heavy brush. Use of this skid cutter is limited to standard brush cutting. Use in significantly larger or denser brush will result in excessive heat and may damage the skid cutter or the skid steer.

### Safety Information

> **DANGER**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> *   Rotary Cutters have the ability to discharge objects at high speeds; therefore, the use of front and rear safety guards is mandatory when cutting along roadways and in areas where people may be present. Stop blade rotation if a bystander is in or around the area.
> *   Do not use cutter as a fan. Cutting blades are not properly designed or guarded for this use.
> *   Do not operate cutter with skid shoes higher than 16 1/2" off the ground. Always use height adjusting safety chain to limit cutting height. Raising cutter too high will throw debris at the operator.
> *   All guards and shields must be installed and in good working condition while operating the attachment.
> *   Do not operate cutter after dark without working lights. The equipment can hit unseen objects or be hit by other vehicles. The operator can loose control of the power unit and cutter causing a wreck or roll-over.

> **WARNING**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> *   Hydraulic fluid under high pressure can penetrate the skin and/or eyes causing a serious injury. Wear protective gloves and safety glasses or goggles when working with hydraulic systems. Use a piece of cardboard or wood rather than hands when searching for leaks. A doctor familiar with this type of injury must treat the injury within a few hours or gangrene may result. DO NOT DELAY.
> *   Never carry riders on the attachment or power machine.
> *   Do not cut on steep inclines. The power machine could flip over causing damage to the equipment and serious bodily injury or death.
> *   Do not operate any hammer or mulching equipment on an open cab machine or on a machine with a tempered front glass window/door. We strongly recommend use of a polycarbonate front glass door/window when operating any hammer or mulching equipment.
> *   Allow only persons to operate this implement who have fully read and comprehended this manual, who have been properly trained in the safe operation of this implement, and who are age 16 or older.
> *   Do not become entangled in hydraulic hoses while entering or exiting the skid steer operator station.
> *   Do not operate cutter without a polycarbonate door mounted to the cab and protective eye wear such as safety glasses or goggles.
> *   Do not abuse equipment. Incorrect use of the attachment can damage equipment structurally and cause serious injury or death.
> *   Do not travel too fast. The rougher the terrain, the slower you must travel.
> *   Do not use attachment to lift, carry, push or tow other equipment and objects.
> *   Do not use attachment to pull and/or pry fence posts, stumps, roots, rocks, or other objects out of the ground.
> *   Do not use attachment as a lifting device for people or as a work platform.

### Cutting Instructions

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not over angle hitch plate forward. Over angling can cause damage to deck and hitch.

The Skid Cutter should be operated in one of three ways:
a. If cutting grass, weeds, or light brush operate with the deck rear slightly higher than deck front.
b. If cutting heavy brush, operate with the deck front 3" to 5" higher than the deck rear for the length of the cutter. Lower the deck front and backup slowly mulching the debris and leveling brush root spike to ground level.
c. If cutting and mulching trees, operate by raising deck front 12" to 15" higher than deck rear. Cut the tree so that it falls away from the operator. Upon tree falling, back up, then lower the deck front 6", drive forward to remove stump, back up, lower deck front to the ground, drive forward to mulch the stump to ground level. Lift deck front 12" to 15" and repeat steps above to mulch the fallen tree.

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not lower operating mulcher down onto trees, saplings or bushes that are 12" tall.
> **NOTE**: Your cutter is equipped with free swinging cutting blades to reduce shock loads to the cutter when striking an obstacle.

1.  Thoroughly inspect the area to be cut for debris and unforeseen objects. Mark any potential hazards.
2.  Set skid steer hydraulic lift arms and hitch angle to position the deck front at the preferred cutting height and the deck rear slightly higher.
3.  Start the skid steer and engage hydraulic motor. Allow several seconds for cutter blades to become aligned properly. If deck continues to vibrate after several seconds, stop motor and inspect blades.
4.  It is important to maintain correct hydraulic motor speed. Loss of motor speed will allow the blades to hinge back and result in ragged, uneven cutting.
5.  Ground speed depends on two things: the density of material being cut and size of skid steer. Never run fast enough to overload the skid steer or cutter.
6.  This cutter was designed to cut brush and small trees on gently sloping or slightly contoured right-of-ways, pastures, set aside acres, and row crop fields.

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not operate cutter or navigate turns with front of the skid steer off the ground. Operating in above fashion will cause damage to deck & hitch. Refer to Figure 3-1.

### Transporting
> **WARNING**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> When traveling on roadways, travel in such a way that other vehicles may pass you safely. Use LED lights, clean reflectors, and a slow moving vehicle sign that is visible from the back to warn operators in other vehicles of your presence. Always comply with all federal, state, and local laws.

1.  Be sure to reduce ground speed when turning; and, leave enough clearance so the Skid Cutter does not contact obstacles such as buildings, trees, or fences.
2.  Select a safe ground travel speed when transporting from one area to another.
3.  Decrease transport speed when traveling over rough or hilly terrain.
4.  When transporting skid steer and Skid Cutter on a trailer:
    *   Use towing vehicle and trailer of adequate capacity.
    *   Always drive up a ramp with heavy end uphill.
    *   Engage skid steer park brake and remove ignition switch key once it is loaded.
    *   Secure skid steer loader and attachment using tie-downs and chains.

### Skid Steer Shutdown Procedures
The following are basic skid steer shutdown procedures. Follow these procedures and any additional shutdown procedures provided in your skid steer Operator's Manual before leaving the operator's seat.
1.  Reduce engine speed and shut-off all power to the attachment.
2.  Park on solid, level ground and lower attachment until it is flat on the ground or on solid (non-concrete) support blocks.
3.  Turn off engine, and remove switch key to prevent unauthorized starting.
4.  Relieve all hydraulic pressure to auxiliary hydraulic lines.
5.  If included, raise seat bar and move controls until both lock.
6.  Wait for all components to come to a complete stop before leaving the operator's seat.
7.  Use steps, grab-handles and anti-slip surfaces when stepping on and off the skid steer or attachment.

### General Operating Instructions
It is absolutely essential that you read and understand both the Operator's Manual for your Kubota Skid Cutter and the Operator's Manual for the skid steer unit you intend to attach it to before attempting to operate or cut with this combination of equipment. We highly recommend that you be a skilled and competent skid steer operator prior to attaching and attempting to use the Skid Cutter. If there is any part of the information above or safe operating procedures you do not understand, please contact your nearest authorized dealer for a full explanation and training session if necessary.

If attachment is to be operated in reverse, make sure visibility to the rear of the power unit is appropriate for the attachment. Backup camera or mirror is recommended. Maintain cleanliness of lens or mirror.

### Skid Steer Operating Instructions
> **WARNING**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> Do not operate any hammer or mulching equipment on an open cab machine or on a machine with a tempered front glass window/door. We strongly recommend use of a polycarbonate front glass door/window when operating any hammer or mulching equipment.

Dress appropriately for the task. You will need to put on protective eye wear such as safety glasses, goggles, or a face shield. A hard hat, steel toed safety shoes, gloves, and hearing protection are also highly recommended. Never wear loose fitting clothing. A respirator or filter mask will help reduce the amount of dust, pollen, or agricultural chemicals potentially inhaled by the operator.

Perform a static or non-running pre-inspection of the skid steer unit. Ensure the skid steer is equipped with a fully functioning ROPS, seat belts, and an operator safety enclosure with a polycarbonate door. If operated on roadways, it must have appropriate SMV and lighting packages. The cutter drive motor must be matched to the hydraulic capacity of the skid steer.

Perform a running check of the skid steer unit. Use hand-holds to enter the operator's compartment. Fasten your seat belt. Orient yourself with all controls. With the park brake on and no one nearby, start the engine. At approximately one third throttle, test all controls. If there is an equipment failure, shut the unit down and make immediate and full repairs.

### Skid Cutter Operating Instructions
Once all systems with the skid steer are "go" and fully functioning, it is time to connect to your SC7072. Maneuver the skid steer mounting plate into position under the universal quick hitch top angle bar. Lower mower to approximately two inches above ground, turn the engine off, set the park brake, and climb out. Lock the latch handles to engage the hitch pins. Connect the hydraulic hoses and case drain. Connect the height limiting safety chain to restrict cutting height to no more than eighteen inches.

Complete a pre-operation check of the cutter. Ensure all guards, shields, chains, and deflectors are in place. Hardware must be tight. Damaged, severely worn, or defective parts must be replaced.

Always inspect the area you intend to cut for debris and hazards. No one should be allowed within 100 yards of this cutter when in operation. If someone approaches, shut the cutter down immediately. The blades should never contact wire, cable, rope, or chains.

The best mowing results will be achieved at speeds up to 2 mph or as vegetation and ground conditions dictate. For tall or dense brush, two passes may be needed. The optional pressure gauge helps determine the optimal ground speed without stalling the cutter (pressure should be up to within 500 PSI of the skid steer's output).

**Cutting Operation (Figure 3-2)**
*   **Forward & Reverse**: Deck is open in front and rear. The direction of travel while cutting should be forward & reverse.
*   **Side to Side**: Never swing deck side to side without first raising the deck off the ground and high enough to clear all obstacles.

> **IMPORTANT**: Use of this Skid Cutter is limited to standard brush cutting. Use in significantly larger or denser brush will result in excessive heat and may damage the Skid Cutter or the skid steer.

When you need to stop, set the park brake, shut the skid steer engine off, and allow time for the blades to stop rotating before you exit the power unit.

## Section 5: Maintenance & Lubrication

### Maintenance
Proper servicing and adjustment are key to the long life of any attachment. With careful inspection and routine maintenance, you can avoid costly downtime and repair.

Check all bolts after using unit for several hours to be sure they are tight. Replace any worn, damaged, or illegible safety labels by obtaining new labels from your Kubota dealer.

The parts on your cutter have been specially designed and should only be replaced with genuine Kubota parts. Do not alter the cutter in a way which will adversely affect its performance.

> **DANGER**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> Always secure equipment with solid, non-concrete supports before working under it. Never go under equipment supported by concrete blocks or hydraulics.

> **WARNING**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> *   Do not alter attachment or replace parts on the attachment with other brands. Other brands may not fit properly or meet OEM specifications.
> *   Buildup of debris around moving components and gearboxes is a fire hazard. Keep rotating parts and gearboxes free from debris.
> *   Backup alarm must be in good working order to warn others. Use a backup camera or rear-view mirror.

### Hydraulic Maintenance
> **WARNING**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> Hydraulic fluid under high pressure can penetrate the skin and/or eyes causing a serious injury. Wear protective gloves and safety glasses or goggles. Use a piece of cardboard or wood rather than hands when searching for leaks. A doctor familiar with this type of injury must treat the injury within a few hours or gangrene may result. DO NOT DELAY.

One of the most important things you can do to prevent hydraulic system problems is to ensure that your skid steer reservoir remains free of dirt and contamination. Use a clean cloth to wipe the hose ends before attaching them to your skid steer. Replace the filter element for your skid steer's hydraulic system at the prescribed intervals.

### Cutter Blade Maintenance
> **WARNING**: To avoid serious injury or death:
> *   Always shut power machine down using the "Shutdown Procedure" provided in this manual before servicing, adjusting, cleaning, or maintaining the attachment.
> *   Do not operate cutter with blades that are out-of-balance, bent, excessively worn, excessively nicked, or with blade bolts that are excessively worn. Such blades can break loose at high speeds.

> **IMPORTANT**: Replace blades in sets with genuine OEM blades only. Not replacing blades in sets will result in an out-of-balance condition that could contribute to premature bearing wear/breakage and/or structural cracks in gearbox and/or deck.

Always inspect blades before each use. Blades that are damaged, worn, bent, or excessively nicked should be replaced. Never try to straighten a bent blade!
