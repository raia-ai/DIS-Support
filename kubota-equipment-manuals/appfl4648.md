- While transporting and operating equipment, watch out for objects overhead and along side such as fences, trees, buildings, wires, etc.
- Store attachment in an area where children normally do not play. When needed, secure attachment against falling with support blocks.

### Look for the Safety Alert Symbol
The SAFETY ALERT SYMBOL indicates there is a potential hazard to personal safety and extra precaution must be taken. When you see this symbol, be alert and carefully read the message that follows it. Hazard control, and accident prevention are dependent upon the awareness, concern, prudence, and proper training of personnel involved in the operation, transport, maintenance, and storage of equipment.

**Be Aware of Signal Words**
A signal word designates a degree or level of hazard seriousness. The signal words are:
> **DANGER**
> Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury.

> **WARNING**
> Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury.

> **CAUTION**
> Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, may result in minor or moderate injury.

### Safety Precautions for Children
Tragedy can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children generally are attracted to attachments and their work.
- Never assume children will remain where you last saw them.
- Keep children out of the work area and under the watchful eye of a responsible adult.
- Be alert and shut the attachment and skid steer/track loader down if children enter the work area.
- Never carry children on the power machine or attachment. There is not a safe place for them to ride. They may fall off and be run over or interfere with the control of the power machine.
- Never allow children to operate the power machine, even under adult supervision.
- Never allow children to play on the power machine or attachment.
- Use extra caution when backing up. Before the power machine starts to move, look down and behind to make sure the area is clear.

### Skid Steer Shutdown And Storage
- Reduce engine speed and shut-off all power to the attachment.
- Park on solid, level ground and lower attachment until it is flat on the ground or support blocks.
- Turn off engine. Do not remove ignition key at this time.
- Turn ignition key to the "RUN" position. Relieve all hydraulic pressure by moving both joysticks.
- Turn ignition key to Off and remove to prevent unauthorized starting.
- If included, raise seat bar and move controls until both lock.
- Wait for all components to stop before leaving operator's seat.
- Use steps, grab-handles and anti-slip surfaces when stepping on and off the skid steer.

### Dig Safe - Avoid Underground Utilities
- **USA:** Call 811
- **CAN:** digsafecanada.ca
- Always contact your local utility companies (electrical, telephone, gas, water, sewer, and others) before digging so that they may mark the location of any underground services in the area.
- Be sure to ask how close you can work to the marks they positioned.

### Transport Safely
- Comply with federal, state, and local laws.
- Use towing vehicle and trailer of adequate size and capacity. Secure equipment towed on a trailer with chocks, tie downs, and chains.
- Sudden braking can cause a towed trailer to swerve unexpectedly. Reduce speed if towed trailer is not equipped with brakes.
- Avoid contact with any overhead utility lines or electrically charged conductors.
- Always drive with load on end of loader arms low to the ground.
- Always drive straight up and down steep inclines with heavy end of skid steer on the "uphill" side.
- Engage park brake when stopped on an incline.
- Maximum transport speed for an attached equipment is 20 mph. DO NOT EXCEED. Never travel at a speed which does not allow adequate control of steering and stopping. Some rough terrains require a slower speed.
- As a guideline, use the following maximum speed weight ratios for attached equipment:
  - 20 mph when weight of attached equipment is less than or equal to the weight of machine towing the equipment.
  - 10 mph when weight of attached equipment exceeds weight of machine towing equipment but not more than double the weight.
- **IMPORTANT:** Do not tow a load that is more than double the weight of the vehicle towing the load.

### Tire Safety
- Tire changing can be dangerous and must be performed by trained personnel using the correct tools and equipment.
- Always properly match the wheel size to the properly sized tire.
- Always maintain correct tire pressure. Do not inflate tires above recommended pressures shown in the Operator's Manual.
- When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.
- Securely support the implement when changing a wheel.
- When removing and installing wheels, use wheel handling equipment adequate for the weight involved.
- Make sure wheel bolts have been tightened to the specified torque.

### Practice Safe Maintenance
- Understand procedure before doing work. Refer to the Operator's Manual for additional information.
- Work on a level surface in a clean dry area that is well-lit.
- Lower attachment to the ground and follow all shutdown procedures before leaving the operator's seat to perform maintenance.
- Do not work under any hydraulically supported equipment. It can settle, suddenly leak down, or be lowered accidentally. If it is necessary to work under the equipment, securely support it with stands or suitable blocking beforehand.
- Use properly grounded electrical outlets and tools.
- Use correct tools and equipment for the job that are in good condition.
- Allow equipment to cool before working on it.
- Disconnect battery ground cable (-) before servicing or adjusting electrical systems or before welding on equipment.
- Inspect all parts. Make certain that parts are in good condition & installed properly.
- Replace parts on this attachment with genuine Kubota parts only. Do not alter this attachment in a way which will adversely affect its performance.
- Do not grease or oil attachment while it is in operation.
- Remove buildup of grease, oil, or debris.
- Always make sure any material and waste products from the repair and maintenance of the attachment are properly collected and disposed.
- Remove all tools and unused parts from the equipment before operation.

### Prepare for Emergencies
- Be prepared if a fire starts.
- Keep a first aid kit and fire extinguisher handy.
- Keep emergency numbers for doctor, ambulance, hospital, and fire department near phone.

### Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Wear protective clothing and equipment appropriate for the job such as safety shoes, safety glasses, hard hat, dust mask, and ear plugs.
- Clothing should fit snug without fringes and pull strings to avoid entanglement with moving parts.
- Prolonged exposure to loud noise can cause hearing impairment or hearing loss. Wear suitable hearing protection such as earmuffs or earplugs.
- Operating a machine safely requires the operator's full attention. Avoid wearing headphones while operating equipment.

### Avoid High Pressure Fluids
- Escaping fluid under pressure will penetrate the skin or eyes causing serious injury.
- Relieve all residual pressure before disconnecting hydraulic lines or performing work on the hydraulic system.
- Make sure all hydraulic fluid connections are properly tightened/torqued and all hydraulic hoses and lines are in good condition before applying pressure to the system.
- Use a piece of paper or cardboard, NOT BODY PARTS, to check for suspected leaks.
- Wear protective gloves and safety glasses or goggles when working with hydraulic systems.
- DO NOT DELAY. If an accident occurs, seek immediate emergency medical care or gangrene may result.

### Use Safety Lights and Devices
- A slow moving power machine can create a hazard when driven on public roads. They are difficult to see, especially at night. Use the Slow Moving Vehicle (SMV) sign when on public roads.
- Flashing warning lights and turn signals are recommended whenever driving on public roads.

### Use Seat Belt and ROPS
- Kubota recommends the use of a CAB or roll-over-protective-structures (ROPS) and seat belt in almost all power machines. Combination of a CAB or ROPS and seat belt will reduce the risk of serious injury or death if the power machine should be upset.
- If ROPS is in the locked-up position, fasten seat belt snugly and securely to help protect against serious injury or death from falling and machine overturn.

### Keep Riders Off Machinery
- Never carry riders on skid steer or attachment.
- Riders obstruct operator's view and interfere with the control of the power machine.
- Riders can be struck by objects or thrown from the equipment.
- Never use skid steer or attachment to lift or transport riders.

### Avoid crystalline Silica (quartz) Dust
Because crystalline silica is a basic component of sand and granite, many activities at construction sites produce dust containing crystalline silica. Trenching, sawing, and boring of material containing crystalline silica can produce dust containing crystalline silica particles. This dust can cause serious injury to the lungs (silicosis).
There are guidelines which should be followed if crystalline silica (quartz) is present in the dust.
- Be aware of and follow OSHA (or other local, State, or Federal) guidelines for exposure to airborne crystalline silica.
- Know the work operations where exposure to crystalline silica may occur.
- Participate in air monitoring or training programs offered by the employer.
- Be aware of and use optional equipment controls such as water sprays, local exhaust ventilation, and enclosed cabs with positive pressure air conditioning if the machine has such equipment. Otherwise respirators shall be worn.
- Where respirators are required, wear a respirator approved for protection against crystalline silica containing dust. Do not alter respirator in any way. Workers who use tight-fitting respirators can not have beards/mustaches which interfere with the respirator seal to the face.
- If possible, change into disposable or washable work clothes at the work site; shower and change into clean clothing before leaving the work site.
- Do not eat, drink, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in areas where there is dust containing crystalline silica.
- Store food, drink, and personal belongings away from the work area.
- Wash hands and face before eating, drinking, smoking, or applying cosmetics after leaving the exposure area.

### Handle Chemicals Properly
- Protective clothing should be worn.
- Handle all chemicals with care.
- Follow instructions on container label.
- Agricultural chemicals can be dangerous. Improper use can seriously injure persons, animals, plants, soil, and property.
- Inhaling smoke from any type of chemical fire can be a serious health hazard.
- Store or dispose of unused chemicals as specified by the chemical manufacturer.

5. Turn ignition key off and remove to prevent unauthorized starting.
6. If included, raise seat bar and move controls until both lock.
7. Wait for all components to come to a complete stop before leaving the operator's seat.
8. Use steps, grab-handles and anti-slip surfaces when stepping on and off the skid steer or attachment.

### Pallet Fork Operation
If the attachment is to be operated in reverse, ensure visibility is adequate. A backup camera or mirror is recommended.

#### Picking Up a Load
1. Make sure the load does not exceed the smaller of two lift capacities:
   - Rated lift capacity of the pallet forks.
   - 83% of the rated lift capacity of the skid steer or track loader.
   > **IMPORTANT:** Using 83% of the rated lift capacity accounts for increased loader stresses and ensures proper front tire rating. On heavy loads, the center of gravity should not be positioned farther than 24" away from the vertical face of the forks.
2. Center forks under the pallet to evenly distribute the weight.
3. Make sure the load is balanced and secure.
4. Check for overhead obstructions.
5. Stop completely before positioning forks at the correct height.
6. Drive into the load as far as possible.
7. Lift load just off the ground and tilt it back slightly.
8. Back out slowly to clear racks or other obstacles.
9. Position load at a safe traveling height before moving. Two to four inches (5 cm to 10 cm) above the floor is recommended.

#### Traveling With a Load
1. Pedestrians always have the right-of-way.
2. Keep load tilted back slightly.
3. Keep forks low, two to four inches above the ground, when possible.
4. Continually scan all sides for pedestrians or other traffic.
5. The operator must have good visibility. If the load is large and blocks the view, travel in reverse.
6. Always drive at a safe speed and slow down when going around corners. Avoid sudden braking.
7. Leave enough clearance when turning to keep pallet forks and load from contacting obstacles.
8. When traveling over a ramp or incline, keep palletized load on the "uphill" side.
9. When possible, travel straight up and down grades, ramps, and inclines.
10. Raise or lower load only when stopped, never while traveling.
11. Slow down when traveling over rough or hilly terrain.
12. Do not transport loads on public roadways.
13. When traveling on public roadways, transport in such a way that faster moving vehicles may pass you safely.
14. Plan your route to avoid heavy traffic.

#### Placing a Load
1. Stop in front of desired location to place the load.
2. Slowly raise load to required height.
3. Move forward slowly with load raised until load is positioned square and straight above its final destination.
4. Level load to position it for placement.
5. Lower load onto its final resting location.
6. Before backing, check all sides for pedestrians or other traffic.
7. Once load has settled, back up slowly.
8. Make sure forks clear pallet before turning or changing fork height.
9. Lower forks before moving again.

### Unhook Pallet Fork
1. Skip to step 4 if quick hitch lock pins are hydraulically actuated. Otherwise continue with step 2.
2. Shutdown power machine before dismounting. Refer to "Power Machine Shutdown Procedure".
3. Pull up on the lock pin levers on the loader hitch plate to remove the lock pins from the bottom slots in the attachment's hitch plate.
4. Start power machine and raise the attachment off the ground approximately 6".
5. If lock pins on the loader hitch are hydraulically actuated, operate hydraulic lever to fully raise lock pins out of the bottom slots.
6. Tilt top of loader hitch plate forward 5-10 degrees and begin lowering the attachment until the front of the attachment is touching the ground.
7. Continue to slowly lower the attachment until the top angle bars and loader quick hitch have separated.
8. Carefully back power machine away from the attachment.

### General Operating Instructions
Familiarize yourself with the Operator's Manual. Practice attaching, detaching, lifting, lowering, maneuvering, and placing an empty pallet on a level site to gain confidence. Focus on the "don'ts": don't exceed lift capacity, don't lift loads too high, don't tilt the load too far backward, don't drive too fast, don't work on slippery/sloped areas, and don't allow bystanders in the work area. Don't leave the machine with the load raised.
