## Safety Precautions

### Safety First
Read these instructions carefully. It is essential that you read the instructions and safety regulations before you attempt to assemble or use the features that are on this cab/ROPS.

- **Danger:** Indicates an immediate hazardous situation which, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury.
- **Warning:** Indicates a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, may result in death or serious injury.
- **Caution:** Indicates a potentially hazardous situation which, if not avoided, may result in minor or moderate injury.
- **Important:** Indicates that cab or property damage may result if instructions are not carefully followed.
- **NOTE:** All products are designed to give safe, dependable service if they are operated and maintained according to instructions. It is the owner's responsibility to be certain anyone operating this product reads this manual, and all other applicable manuals, to become familiar with this cab and all safety precautions. Failure to do so could result in serious personal injury or cab damage. If you have any questions, consult your dealer. Read and understand this manual before operation.
- **NOTE:** A safe operator is the best assurance against accidents. All operators, no matter how experienced they may be, should read this operator manual and all other related manuals before attempting to operate features in this cab/ROPS and operate the base tractor. Please read the following section and pay particular attention to all safety recommendations contained in this manual and those labelled on the cab and on the tractor.

### General Safety
1. Never let an unqualified or untrained driver operate the tractor.
2. Keep a fire extinguisher, with ABC rating securely fastened in the ROPS. Maintain it and be familiar with its use.
3. Do not carry passengers.
4. Never operate the tractor in a closed building for a prolonged period. Ensure adequate ventilation is present, as engine exhaust fumes are poisonous and can kill.
5. Always keep sleeves, jackets or other loose clothing relatively tight and belted. Loose clothing may catch on moving parts and result in severe personal injury or death.
6. Provide a first-aid kit, securely attached inside of the ROPS for use in case of accident.
7. Never jump from the tractor. There is a danger of tripping or falling on protruding parts.
8. Use steps and hand holds when mounting and dismounting the tractor, or for servicing components too high to reach from the ground.
9. When seated in the ROPS, fasten seat belt before starting the engine. A proper seat belt must be worn at all times when using a ROPS.
10. Safety devices and shields are intended to protect operators from injury or death. Under no circumstances should they be modified, disabled or removed.

### Operating Safety
1. Always operate the tractor controls while sitting in the operator's seat.
2. Lock seat in position and buckle seat belt before operating the tractor.
3. Avoid abrupt sharp turns at high speeds.
4. On sloped terrain, do not make sharp turns as machine stability could be compromised.
5. Operate the tractor smoothly, avoid abrupt starts and stops.
6. Keep all shields in place when operating the tractor.
7. Do not operate the tractor when you are tired, sick, or impaired.
8. Never operate the tractor in confined areas; visibility next to the tractor is reduced. Injury to bystanders or damage to the ROPS or equipment may result.

### Safety Compliance
Carefully review the procedures given in this manual and the tractor operator's manual with all operators annually. It is important that all operators become familiar with, and follow safety precautions. Operating instructions must be given to everyone using the tractor before operation and at least once yearly thereafter in compliance with OSHA Regulations 1928.57 (United States).

### Safe Operation on Rough Terrain
1. Drive the tractor slowly on hillsides and curves to eliminate the danger of tipping. Avoid slopes which are too steep for safe operation. Avoid sharp uphill turns.
2. Always drive slowly enough over rough ground or obstructions. Drive at speeds slows enough to ensure your safety.
3. When driving out of a ditch, gully, or up a steep hillside, engage the clutch slowly. Avoid sharp uphill turns.
4. When descending steep grades, select a sufficiently low gear to maintain control with minimum use of braking.
5. Use caution when driving near the edge of a ditch or gully. It may cave in, causing the tractor to roll over.
6. Be alert when operating near trees, slopes and around obstructions. Tree branches can cause damage to ROPS components.

### Maintenance Safety
1. Remove mud, crop residue, chains, and tools from steps and operator's platform. They may interfere with pedal operation or entry/exit from tractor.
2. When servicing components are too high to reach from the ground use steps and handholds. Do not use fenders or shields that are not designed as steps.

### Safe Highway Operation
1. Before operating the tractor on, or near, public roadways check with your local authorities for any local regulations that will affect you.
2. Equip towed implements with slow moving vehicle (SMV) signs when traveling on public roads.
3. Install additional lights on implement rear to safeguard against rear end collisions.
4. Use hazard warning flashers as required by law when transporting or driving on public roads. If the tractor had warning flashers removed when mounting the ROPS, they must be replaced prior to operation on public roads.
5. Keep to the right, yielding right-of-way traffic, especially if pulling implements. Pull off the road and stop to allow motorists to pass. Drive on the road shoulder, if permitted by law.
6. Use extreme caution when pulling heavy loads at road speeds. Avoid hard application of the tractor brakes at high speed.
7. Always drive slowly near curbs, approaches or ditches.
8. If equipped, ensure headlights are aligned so they will not blind the operators of oncoming vehicles. If the tractor is not equipped with turn signals and law requires them, install them prior to operating on or near public roads.
9. Use your turn signals, checking for traffic well in advance of turning. If the tractor is not equipped with turn signals and law requires them, install them prior to operating on or near public roads.

### Safety Decals
1. Keep decals clean. Remove dirt with a wet clean cloth when necessary.
2. Replace safety decals if destroyed, missing, painted over or unreadable. If any safety decals are covered or obscured when the ROPS is mounted, it is recommended that you purchase replacement decals from the tractor manufacturer. Mount them in a readable location at, or near, their original location before operating the tractor.
3. New ROPS decals and tractor decals are available from your tractor dealer.

### ROPS Safety
1. Install the ROPS in accordance with Tektite mounting instructions. Failure to do so may affect the ROPS ability to withstand a roll over.
2. If the ROPS is subjected to alteration, structural damage or involved in an over turn accident, the entire structure must be replaced. Failure to do so may result in injury or death in the event of a roll over.
3. If the tractor is not equipped with seat belts, purchase approved seat belts from the tractor manufacturer or Tektite prior to operating the tractor.
4. Always fasten seat belts prior to operating the tractor.
5. Always operate the tractor from the operator's seat.
6. Remove mud, crop residue, chains and tools from steps and operator's platform. They may interfere with pedal operation or entry/exit from the tractor.
7. Remove all loose chains, tools, and equipment from the operator's platform. Failure to do so may cause injury or death in the event of a roll over.
8. Do not install the ROPS on a tractor model that the ROPS is not designated for (compatible tractor designations are printed on the ROPS serial number plate). The ROPS is designed specifically for individual models to ensure ROPS requirements will be met. Installing the ROPS on a non designated tractor may result in injury or death.

### Emergency Exits
The deluxe ROPS cab has two doors. Either one can be used during an emergency.

## Operating Instructions

**Important**
The following section locates, identifies and briefly describes the functions of all cab controls. All operators should familiarize themselves with control location and function prior to operating the tractor. Failure to do so may result in unsafe operation of the tractor and possible injury or death to operators and bystanders.

There is one switch plate located in the cab. The following switches are available and their functionality is described.

### Cab Switch Plate

1.  **Front Wiper Rocker Switch (standard)**
    *   Low position: Off
    *   High position: On
    *   Note: indicator light activates when wiper is on.

2.  **Rear Wiper Rocker Switch (not available on all models)**
    *   Low position: Off
    *   High position: On
    *   Note: indicator light activates when wiper is on.

3.  **Front Work Light Rocker Switch (optional)**
    *   Low position: Off

Standard and optional features are individually fused, and the fuses can be accessed behind the plug in the middle of the switch-plate.

### Cab Circuit Protection
The Tektite ROPS cab is wired to provide maximum protection against individual circuit overload. All optional components are fused internally behind the cab switch plate.

### BX23S Cab
The BX23S cab is designed to provide ROPS protection along with reasonable winter weather protection. The deluxe cab design for this model features glass windows at all window locations. The BX tractor draws its air intake from underneath the steering wheel, so the tractor cab cannot be completely sealed, otherwise it will starve the engine for air.

> ** If winter front for machine air intake is ordered with cab, use during WINTER months with cold weather ONLY! Tractor engine will not have enough fresh air intake otherwise. Winter front MUST be off tractor during warm weather! Tektite is not responsible if winter front is left on tractor and engine over-heating occurs in the summer months.

## Post-Installation Checks

Before starting a tractor equipped with a Tektite ROPS cab:
1.  Clear the operator platform of all tools. Tools left in or around the ROPS and tractor can cause operator interference which could lead to bodily injury and/or damage the machine.
2.  Inspect the ROPS and tractor to ensure all bolts are tight and re-tighten if required.
3.  Ensure that all pedals, levers, and controls have adequate clearance for normal operation.
4.  Ensure that all electrical components of both the ROPS and tractor operate normally.
5.  Ensure your door latches properly onto the striker pin. Immediately after installation, the ROPS frame may flex slightly from installation, and the door latch will need to be re-aligned for proper operation. Loosen the striker pin, striker mounting plate and door latch as necessary to get a proper alignment of the door striker.
