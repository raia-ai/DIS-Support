### Look for the Safety Alert Symbol

The SAFETY ALERT SYMBOL indicates there is a potential hazard to personal safety involved and extra safety precaution must be taken. When you see this symbol, be alert and carefully read the message that follows it. In addition to design and configuration of equipment, hazard control, and accident prevention are dependent upon the awareness, concern, prudence, and proper training of personnel involved in the operation, transport, maintenance, and storage of equipment.

### Be Aware of Signal Words

A signal word designates a degree or level of hazard seriousness. The signal words are:

> **DANGER**
> Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury.

> **WARNING**
> Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury.

> **CAUTION**
> Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, may result in minor or moderate injury.

### Safety Precautions for Children

Tragedy can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children generally are attracted to attachments and their work.
- Never assume children will remain where you last saw them.
- Keep children out of the work area and under the watchful eye of a responsible adult.
- Be alert and shut the attachment and skid steer/track loader down if children enter the work area.
- Never carry children on the power machine or attachment. There is not a safe place for them to ride. They may fall off and be run over or interfere with the control of the power machine.
- Never allow children to operate the power machine, even under adult supervision.
- Never allow children to play on the power machine or attachment.
- Use extra caution when backing up. Before the power machine starts to move, look down and behind to make sure the area is clear.

### Skid Steer Shutdown And Storage

- Reduce engine speed and shut-off all power to the attachment.
- Park on solid, level ground and lower attachment until it is flat on the ground or support blocks.
- Turn off engine, and remove switch key to prevent unauthorized starting.
- Relieve all hydraulic pressures.
- If included, raise seat bar and move controls until both lock.
- Wait for all components to stop before leaving operator's seat.
- Use steps, grab-handles and anti-slip surfaces when stepping on and off the skid steer.
- Detach and store attachment in an area where children normally do not play. Secure attachment by using blocks and supports.

### Tire Safety

- Tire changing can be dangerous and must be performed by trained personnel using the correct tools and equipment.
- Always maintain correct tire pressure. Do not inflate tires above recommended pressures shown in the Operator's Manual.
- When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.
- Securely support the attachment when changing a wheel.
- When removing and installing wheels, use wheel handling equipment adequate for the weight involved.
- Make sure wheel bolts have been tightened to the specified torque.

### Transport Safely

- Comply with federal, state, and local laws.
- Use towing vehicle and trailer of adequate size and capacity. Secure equipment towed on a trailer with chocks, tie downs, and chains.
- Sudden braking can cause a towed trailer to swerve and upset. Reduce speed if towed trailer is not equipped with brakes.
- Avoid contact with any overhead utility lines or electrically charged conductors.
- Always drive with load on end of loader arms low to the ground.
- Always drive straight up and down steep inclines with heavy end of skid steer on the "uphill" side.
- Engage park brake when stopped on an incline.
- Maximum transport speed for an attached equipment is 20 mph. DO NOT EXCEED. Never travel at a speed which does not allow adequate control of steering and stopping. Some rough terrains require a slower speed.
- As a guideline, use the following maximum speed weight ratios for attached equipment:
  - 20 mph when weight of attached equipment is less than or equal to the weight of machine towing the equipment.
  - 10 mph when weight of attached equipment exceeds weight of machine towing equipment but not more than double the weight.
- **IMPORTANT**: Do not tow a load that is more than double the weight of the vehicle towing the load.

### Dig Safe - Avoid Underground Utilities

- **USA:** Call 811
- **CAN:** [digsafecanada.ca](http.digsafecanada.ca)
- Always contact your local utility companies (electrical, telephone, gas, water, sewer, and others) before digging so that they may mark the location of any underground services in the area.
- Be sure to ask how close you can work to the marks they positioned.

### Practice Safe Maintenance

- Understand procedure before doing work. Refer to the Operator's Manual for additional information.
- Work on a level surface in a clean dry area that is well-lit.
- Lower attachment to the ground and follow all shutdown procedures before leaving the operator's seat to perform maintenance.
- Do not work under any hydraulic supported equipment. It can settle, suddenly leak down, or be lowered accidentally. If it is necessary to work under the equipment, securely support it with stands or suitable blocking beforehand.
- Use properly grounded electrical outlets and tools.
- Use correct tools and equipment for the job that are in good condition.
- Allow equipment to cool before working on it.
- Disconnect battery ground cable (-) before servicing or adjusting electrical systems or before welding on equipment.
- Inspect all parts. Make certain parts are in good condition & installed properly.
- Replace parts on this attachment with genuine Kubota parts only. Do not alter this attachment in a way which will adversely affect its performance.
- Do not grease or oil attachment while it is in operation.
- Remove buildup of grease, oil, or debris.
- Always make sure any material and waste products from the repair and maintenance of the attachment are properly collected and disposed.
- Remove all tools and unused parts from the equipment before operation.

### Prepare for Emergencies

- Be prepared if a fire starts.
- Keep a first aid kit and fire extinguisher handy.
- Keep emergency numbers for doctor, ambulance, hospital, and fire department near phone.

### Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

- Wear protective clothing and equipment appropriate for the job such as safety shoes, safety glasses, hard hat, and ear plugs.
- Clothing should fit snug without fringes and pull strings to avoid entanglement with moving parts.
- Prolonged exposure to loud noise can cause hearing impairment or hearing loss. Wear suitable hearing protection such as earmuffs or earplugs.
- Operating equipment safely requires the operator's full attention. Avoid wearing headphones while operating equipment.

### Avoid High Pressure Fluids Hazard

- Escaping fluid under pressure can penetrate the skin causing serious injury.
- Relieve all residual pressure before disconnecting hydraulic lines or performing work on the hydraulic system.
- Make sure all hydraulic fluid connections are tight and all hydraulic hoses and lines are in good condition before applying pressure to the system.
- Use a piece of paper or cardboard, NOT BODY PARTS, to check for suspected leaks.
- Wear protective gloves and safety glasses or goggles when working with hydraulic systems.
- **DO NOT DELAY.** If an accident occurs, see a doctor familiar with this type of injury immediately. Any fluid injected into the skin or eyes must be treated within a few hours or gangrene may result.

### Use Safety Lights and Devices

- Slow moving tractors, skid steers, and self-propelled machines can create a hazard when driven on public roads. They are difficult to see, especially at night. Use the Slow Moving Vehicle (SMV) sign when on public roads.
- Flashing warning lights and turn signals are recommended whenever driving on public roads.

### Use Seat Belt and ROPS

- Kubota recommends the use of a CAB or roll-over-protective-structures (ROPS) and seat belt in almost all power machines. Combination of a CAB or ROPS and seat belt will reduce the risk of serious injury or death if the power machine should be upset.
- If ROPS is in the locked-up position, fasten seat belt snugly and securely to help protect against serious injury or death from falling and machine overturn.

### Keep Riders Off Machinery

- Never carry riders on skid steer or attachment.
- Riders obstruct operator's view and interfere with the control of the power machine.
- Riders can be struck by objects or thrown from the equipment.
- Never use skid steer or attachment to lift or transport riders.

## Introduction

Kubota welcomes you to the growing family of new product owners. This Skid Steer Rotary Cutter has been designed with care and built by skilled workers using quality materials. Proper assembly, maintenance, and safe operating practices will help you get years of satisfactory use from this product.

### Application

SC4060 & SC4072 construction grade cutters are designed with the commercial or high use consumer in mind. The SC40 cutter features a rigid mounting system, 1/4" thick deck, 3 swinging blades and a solid blade carrier allowing it to cut and shred brush or trees up to 4" in diameter. The strong, reinforced leading edge of the SC40 cutter allows the operator to push trees and brush over without damaging the unit. The 2" to 18" cut height range makes this cutter ideal for clearing right-of-ways along road sides, pipelines or under electrical transmission lines with the speed and efficiency needed by today's contractors. Farmers, ranchers and land developers will also benefit from this unit when clearing pastures or new development areas. The SC40 cutter utilizes the power, compact size and the go anywhere ability of a skid steer or CTL to access over grown areas where a tractor and rotary cutter cannot go. The front roller option along with the aggressive taper on the standard full length skid shoes prevent the cutter from digging in or getting hung up in the soft ground usually found under heavy brush.

See "Specifications & Capacities" on page 29 and "Features & Benefits" on page 31 for additional information and performance enhancing options.

## Section 2: Adjustments

### Height Adjustment Safety Chain

> **DANGER**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> - Do not operate cutter with skid shoes higher than 16 1/2" off the ground. Always use height adjusting safety chain to limit cutting height. Raising cutter too high will throw debris at the operator.
> - Do not tilt hitch plate to raise front of cutter higher than the rear. Raising front of cutter can cause serious bodily injury and/or death.
> - Always secure equipment with solid, non-concrete supports before working under it. Never go under equipment supported by concrete blocks or hydraulics. Concrete can break, hydraulic lines can burst, and/or hydraulic controls can be actuated even when power to hydraulics is off.

For safety, the cutter skid shoes should not be raised higher than 16 1/2" off the ground (18" maximum cutting height).

> **NOTE:** Two people may be required to install and adjust the height adjustment safety chain.

1. Raise cutter's rear skid shoes slightly less than 16 1/2" off the ground. Secure the cutter with support blocks.
2. Run height adjustment safety chain under the upper cross tube and skid steer hitch plate to the skid steer lower hitch loop. Thread chain through the hitch loop and back toward the hitch plate. Connect quick link coupler to a chain loop as shown in Figure 2-2.
   > **NOTE:** When attaching the Rotary Cutter to a Kubota SVL machine, height adjustment safety chain (#2) should be looped around SVL tie-down bar (#1) and adjusted so that the cutter cannot be raised over 16.5" off the ground as shown in Figure 2-2.
3. Raise cutter up until the safety chain is tight. Check height of rear skid shoes.
4. If rear skid shoes are more than 16 1/2" above ground level, lower cutter and make necessary adjustments to the safety chain to limit rear skid shoe height to 16 1/2" maximum.
5. Tighten quick link coupler nut to secure safety chain.

### Blade Rotation Change
(Refer to Figure 2-3 in the manual)

The SC40 cutter has the capability to switch blade rotation directions. This will help utilize the dual sided blades. Once the blades get dull you can switch blade rotation and use the other side of the blades.

1. Remove 5/16" hex nuts (#4), lock washers (#3) and flat washers (#2). Remove U-bolt (#1).
2. Loosen nuts (#5 & 6). Do not take apart.
3. Loosen nuts (#7 & 8) and remove from hydraulic fittings.
4. Rotate hose fittings (#9 & 10), along with the hoses attached to them, 180 degrees so that fitting (#10) attaches to hose nut (#8) and fitting (#9) attaches to hose nut (#7).
5. Tighten nuts (#5, 6, 7 & 8).
6. Re-install U-bolt (#1) with flat washers (#2), lock washers (#3) and nuts (#4). Tighten to correct torque.
7. Continue to step 8 if you have a pressure gauge option. Otherwise blade rotation change is complete.
8. Remove cap (#11) from fitting (#13) as shown.
9. Remove pressure gauge hose from fitting (#12) and attach the hose to fitting (#13).
10. Attach cap (#11) to fitting (#12).
11. Tighten the cap and pressure gauge hose.

### Equipment Clearances

Visually inspect hydraulic hoses for possible pinch points and length. Make any necessary adjustments before putting equipment into service.

1. If necessary, have someone stand nearby that can motion for the operator to stop if a problem develops while checking for clearances.
2. With deck lowered to its minimum cutting height, slowly tilt the hitch plate back raising the front of the cutter while watching for interferences between skid steer, skid steer wheels, and cutter. Make sure hydraulic hoses are long enough and do not become pinched through the full range of motion.
3. With hydraulic cylinders still retracted, slowly raise cutter up while continuing to watch for interferences between skid steer, skid steer wheels, and cutter until height adjustment safety chain limit is reached.
4. Slowly tilt the hitch plate forward until the front of the deck is touching the ground.
5. Tilt hitch plate back until the deck looks parallel with the ground.
6. Slowly lower deck down while retracting hydraulic cylinders on end of loader arms until deck is level and resting on the ground.
7. Be sure to make any necessary corrections to the hydraulic hoses before putting cutter into service.

## Section 3: Operating Procedures

### Operating Checklist

Hazard control and accident prevention are dependent upon the awareness, concern, prudence, and proper training involved in the operation, transport, storage and maintenance of the Rotary Cutter. It is absolutely essential that no one operates the Rotary Cutter unless they are age 16 or older and have read, fully understood, and are totally familiar with the Operator's Manual. Make sure the operator has paid particular attention to:
- Important Safety Information, page 1
- Section 1: Assembly & Set-up, page 7
- Section 2: Adjustments, page 15
- Section 3: Operating Procedures, page 17
- Section 5: Maintenance & Lubrication, page 24

Perform the following inspections before using your Rotary Cutter.

| Check | Ref. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Make sure guards and shields are in place and secure. | 1 |
| Inspect hydraulic hoses and replace if they are worn, damaged, or leak. Replace with genuine OEM parts. | 3 |
| Grease all fittings. Refer to "Lubrication Points". | 28 |
| Check Rotary Cutter initially and periodically for loose bolts & nuts. See "Torque Values Chart". | 33 |

### Safety Information

> **DANGER**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> - Rotary Cutters have the ability to discharge objects at high speeds; therefore, the use of front and rear safety guards is mandatory when cutting along roadways and in areas where people may be present. Stop blade rotation if a bystander is in or around the area.
> - Do not use cutter as a fan. Cutting blades are not properly designed or guarded for this use.
> - Do not operate cutter with skid shoes higher than 16 1/2" off the ground. Always use height adjusting safety chain to limit cutting height. Raising cutter too high will throw debris at the operator.
> - All guards and shields must be installed and in good working condition while operating the implement.
> - Do not operate cutter after dark without working lights. The equipment can hit unseen objects or be hit by other vehicles. The operator can lose control of the tractor and cutter causing a wreck or roll-over.

> **WARNING**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> - Always shut skid steer down using "Skid Steer Shut Down Procedure" provided in this manual before dismounting to maintain and/or make adjustments to the skid steer cutter.
> - Hydraulic fluid under high pressure can penetrate the skin and/or eyes causing a serious injury. Wear protective gloves and safety glasses or goggles when working with hydraulic systems. Use a piece of cardboard or wood rather than hands when searching for leaks. A doctor familiar with this type of injury must treat the injury within a few hours or gangrene may result. DO NOT DELAY.
> - Do not become entangled in hydraulic hoses while entering or exiting the skid steer operator station.
> - Do not operate and/or travel across inclines where tractor and/or implement can roll over. Consult your tractor's manual for acceptable inclines the tractor is capable of traveling across.
> - Do not operate cutter without a polycarbonate door mounted to the cab and protective eye wear such as safety glasses or goggles. Flying objects from the cutter can cause serious injury to the body and eyes.
> - Do not travel too fast. The rougher the terrain, the slower you must travel. Always travel at a speed slow enough to be able to adjust the deck height before running it into the ground. Also, travel slow enough to stop before running or turning into obstacles ahead and on either side.
> - Do not use attachment to lift, carry, push or tow other equipment and objects. It is not properly designed or guarded for this use.
> - Never carry riders on the attachment or power machine. Riders can obstruct the operator's view, interfere with control of the equipment, be pinched by moving components, become entangled in rotating components, be struck by objects, be thrown or fall from the equipment, etc.
> - Do not use attachment to pull and/or pry fence posts, stumps, roots, rocks, or other objects out of the ground. It is not properly designed or guarded for this use.
> - Do not use attachment as a lifting device for people or as a work platform. It is not properly designed or guarded for this use.
> - Do not operate cutter with blades that are out-of-balance, bent, excessively worn, excessively nicked, or with blade bolts that are excessively worn. Such blades can break loose at high speeds.
> - Do not alter attachment or replace parts on the attachment with other brands. Other brands may not fit properly or meet OEM specifications. They can weaken the integrity and impair the safety, function, performance, and life of the attachment. Replace parts only with genuine OEM parts.
> - Do not exceed rated cutting capacity of your cutter. See specifications & capacities for specified cutting capacity. Exceeding rated cutting capacity can damage drive components, cutter blades, and deck components.
> - Cutter deck can be slippery especially when wet. Always step on anti-slip surfaces when possible. Never hurry. Make sure you have secure footing and hand hold when walking on the deck.
> - Buildup of debris around moving components and gearboxes is a fire hazard. Keep rotating parts and gearboxes free from debris to avoid serious injury and property damage.
> - Avoid catching hydraulic hoses on brush, posts, tree limbs, and other protrusions that could damage and/or break them.

> **IMPORTANT:** Do not over angle hitch plate forward. Over angling can cause damage to deck and hitch.

The Rotary Cutter should be operated with front roller wheels on the ground and deck rear slightly higher off the ground than deck front. As the operator travels over uneven terrain, the skid steer hitch plate tilt angle and lift arm height may need some readjusting to maintain correct deck positioning.

### Transporting

> **WARNING**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> When traveling on roadways, travel in such a way that other vehicles may pass you safely. Use LED lights, clean reflectors, and a slow moving vehicle sign that is visible from the back to warn operators in other vehicles of your presence. Always comply with all federal, state, and local laws.

1. Be sure to reduce ground speed when turning; and, leave enough clearance so the Rotary Cutter does not contact obstacles such as buildings, trees, or fences.
2. Select a safe ground travel speed that is 20 mph or less when transporting from one area to another. When traveling on roadways, transport in such a way that faster moving vehicles may pass you safely.
3. Decrease transport speed when traveling over rough or hilly terrain.
4. When transporting skid steer and Rotary Cutter on a trailer:
   - Use towing vehicle and trailer of adequate capacity.
   - Always drive up a ramp with heavy end uphill.
   - Engage skid steer park brake and remove ignition switch key once it is loaded.
   - Secure skid steer loader and attachment using tie-downs and chains.

### Cutting Instructions

> **NOTE:** Your cutter is equipped with free swinging cutting blades to reduce shock loads to the cutter when striking an obstacle.

1. Thoroughly inspect the area to be cut for debris and unforeseen objects. Mark any potential hazards.
2. Set skid steer hydraulic lift arms and hitch angle to position the deck front at the preferred cutting height and the deck rear slightly higher.
3. Start the skid steer and engage hydraulic motor. Allow several seconds for cutter blades to become aligned properly. If deck continues to vibrate after several seconds, stop motor and inspect blades.
4. It is important to maintain correct hydraulic motor speed. Loss of motor speed will allow the blades to hinge back and result in ragged, uneven cutting.
5. Ground speed depends on two things: the density of material being cut and size of skid steer. Never run fast enough to overload the skid steer or cutter.
6. This cutter was designed to cut grass and medium brush cutting on gently sloping or slightly contoured right-of-ways, pastures, set aside acres, and row crop fields.

> **IMPORTANT:** Do not operate cutter or navigate turns with front wheels of skid steer off the ground. Operating in above fashion will cause damage to deck & hitch.

> **IMPORTANT:** The deck is open in the front and rear. Swinging the deck side to side without raising off the ground high enough to clear all obstacles can damage the deck.

7. Always travel straight forward or backward while cutting. Never swing deck side to side without first raising the deck off the ground. Make sure the deck is high enough to clear all obstacles before turning or swinging the deck side to side. The direction of travel while cutting should be forward & reverse.

### General Operating Instructions

It is absolutely essential that you read and understand both the Operator's Manual for your Kubota skid steer Rotary Cutter and the Operator's Manual for the skid steer unit you intend to attach it to before attempting to operate or cut with this combination of equipment. You must be able to read, comprehend, and adhere to all safety warnings and decals in order to avoid personal injury, fatalities, injury to others, or costly damage to property and equipment. We highly recommend that you be a skilled and competent skid steer operator prior to attaching and attempting to use the skid steer Rotary Cutter. If there is any part of the information above or safe operating procedures you do not understand, please contact your nearest authorized dealer for a full explanation and training session if necessary.

### Skid Steer Operating Instructions

Assuming you have met all of the requirements and taken them seriously, it is time to take the next step and that is accomplished by dressing appropriately for the task. You will need to put on protective eye wear such as safety glasses, goggles, or a face shield. A hard hat, steel toed safety shoes, gloves, and hearing protection are also highly recommended. Never wear loose fitting clothing and you may want to put on a respirator or filter mask to avoid breathing in dust, pollen, or agriculturally used toxins that may be present.

The next step is a static or non-running pre-inspection of the skid steer unit. You will want to make sure that the skid steer is equipped with a fully functioning ROPS (Roll Over Protection System) which does include seat belts and an operator safety enclosure. The cab must also be equipped with an Operator Protective Door, which may have been supplied with the skid steer unit. Kubota does offer a protective door with the SC4060 and SC4072 if one is not provided by your skid steer supplier. If the skid steer is to be operated on local roadways, it must be equipped with appropriate Slow Moving Vehicle (SMV) and other required lighting packages so as to make it compliant with state and local department of transportation requirements. The cutter drive motor must be matched to the output of the hydraulic capacity of the skid steer. Failure to do this could result in serious over-speeding of the cutting unit possibly resulting in serious injury, fatalities, or property damage. The universal quick-hitch mount should be in good working order and latches should be located to the open position. There should be no evidence of hydraulic leaks in and around the auxiliary hydraulic couplers. There must be a readily accessible attaching point for the Rotary Cutter lift-limit chain on the lower front portion of the chassis frame. Finally make sure that all shields and safety features are in place and fully functional.

The next step is to perform a running check of the skid steer unit. As you get onto the skid steer and into the operator' compartment always use factory provided hand-holds and don't grab the steering or control levers to ease or stabilize your entry. Fasten your seat belt once you are seated and begin to mentally orient yourself with the position of all controls, switches, pedals, levers, and their related functions. Once you are sure that the park brake is on, no people or animals are in close proximity, all control levers, pedals, and hydraulic systems are in neutral position, go ahead and start the engine. With the engine now running and the throttle at approximately one third, test all controls to make sure they are fully functioning. If at any time there is an equipment failure, shut the unit down and make immediate and full repairs.

### Rotary Cutter Operating Instructions

Assuming all systems with the skid steer are "go" and fully functioning, it is time to connect to the SC4060 or SC4072 Rotary Cutter. This is done by maneuvering the skid steer mounting plate into position under the universal quick hitch top angle bar. Once this is accomplished and the mower is fully supported by the skid steer lift arms, lower mower to a point approximately two inches above ground. Turn the engine off, set the parking brake, and climb out of the skid steer. Lock the latch handles down to engage the hitch pins. Connect the hydraulic hoses to the appropriate auxiliary hydraulic outlets and case drain making sure to keep connectors clean. (Note: Hydraulic flow direction on all skid steers is not the same. Make sure hoses are connected properly or blades will rotate at a much slower speed.) Connect the height limiting safety chain to the chassis attaching point and restrict cutting height to no more that eighteen inches. This completes the attachment of the cutter to the skid steer.

The next step is to complete a pre-operation check of the cutter. Make sure all guards, safety shields, safety chains, and deflectors are in place. All hardware must be in place and appropriately tightened. Damaged, severely worn, or defective parts must be replaced prior to operation.

You should always inspect the area you intend to cut for debris and hazards located on the ground. No one, including people and animals, should be allowed within 100 yards of this cutter when in operation. If someone does approach, shut the cutter down immediately. The blades on this cutter should never be allowed to come in contact with objects such as wire, cable, rope, or chains that might become entangled. These types of entangled objects can become extremely hazardous by rotating outside of the cutter deck housing resulting in serious injury or death. Always inspect the area before you mow.

The best mowing results will be achieved at speeds between 2 mph and 5 mph as ground and mowing conditions dictate. If you are mowing in particularly tall or dense brush, you may want to make two passes with the first pass being higher and the second pass made as a cross-cut at the desired cut height. The pressure gauge option enables the operator to determine the ground speed obtainable without stalling the cutter. When operating with a pressure gauge the pressure reading should be up to within 500 PSI of the skid steer's output. Example: skid steer output = 3500 PSI, if the operator adjusts the ground speed so the pressure gauge reading is up to 3000 PSI then the cutter will not stall. If the ground speed causes the pressure to increase to 3500 PSI the cutter will stall and the blades will stop rotating. Conversely, if the pressure reading is less than 3000 PSI, the operator can increase their ground speed if desired. If you are mowing without the benefit of the front rollers, you will probably need to slow down significantly especially over uneven terrain or furrows. Driving too fast over uneven ground will cause the unit to undulate in a forward pitching motion. The best advice is to drive slow but keep engine speed and blade tip speed high. Once you get the feel of it you can increase speed and productivity.

When you do need to stop, make sure you set the park brake, shut the skid steer engine off, and allow time for the blades to stop rotating before you climb down. With a little practice we are confident you will soon achieve safe and excellent results with your new Kubota SC4060 or SC4072 skid steer Rotary Cutter.

## Section 5: Maintenance & Lubrication

### Maintenance

Proper servicing and adjustment are key to the long life of any attachment. With careful inspection and routine maintenance, you can avoid costly downtime and repair.

Check all bolts after using unit for several hours to be sure they are tight. Replace any worn, damaged, or illegible safety labels by obtaining new labels from your Kubota dealer.

The parts on your cutter have been specially designed and should only be replaced with genuine Kubota parts. Do not alter the cutter in a way which will adversely affect its performance.

> **DANGER**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> - Do not go near or under raised loader arms without first securing loader arms in the raised position with an approved lift-arm support.
> - Always secure equipment with solid, non-concrete supports before working under it. Never go under equipment supported by concrete blocks or hydraulics. Concrete can break, hydraulic lines can burst, and/or hydraulic controls can be actuated even when power to hydraulics is off.

> **WARNING**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> - Always shut power machine down using the "Shutdown Procedure" provided in this manual before servicing, adjusting, cleaning, or maintaining the attachment.
> - Keep body, body extremities, loose clothing, pull strings, etc. away from pinch points such as rotating, extending, and/or retracting components. Secure pinch point areas to ensure they will not move before working on or near them.
> - Perform scheduled maintenance. Check for loose hardware, missing parts, broken parts, structural cracks, and excessive wear. Make repairs before putting implement back into service. Serious breakdowns can result in injury or death.
> - Backup alarm must be in good working order to warn others. Use a rear-view mirror that is in good condition to help see undesirable situations behind the unit. Drive at a slower speed to compensate for blind spots.
> - Do not alter attachment or replace parts on the attachment with other brands. Other brands may not fit properly or meet OEM specifications. They can weaken the integrity and impair the safety, function, performance, and life of the attachment. Replace parts only with genuine OEM parts.
> - Buildup of debris around moving components and gearboxes is a fire hazard. Keep rotating parts and gearboxes free from debris to avoid serious injury and property damage.

### Hydraulic System

> **WARNING**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> Hydraulic fluid under high pressure can penetrate the skin and/or eyes causing a serious injury. Wear protective gloves and safety glasses or goggles when working with hydraulic systems. Use a piece of cardboard or wood rather than hands when searching for leaks. A doctor familiar with this type of injury must treat the injury within a few hours or gangrene may result. DO NOT DELAY.

One of the most important things you can do to prevent hydraulic system problems is to ensure that your skid steer reservoir remains free of dirt and contamination.
Use a clean cloth to wipe the hose ends before attaching them to your skid steer. Replace the filter element for your skid steer's hydraulic system at the prescribed intervals. These simple maintenances will go a long way to prevent occurrence of hydraulic problems.

### Cutter Blade Maintenance

> **WARNING**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> - Always shut power machine down using the "Shutdown Procedure" provided in this manual before servicing, adjusting, cleaning, or maintaining the attachment.
> - Do not operate cutter with blades that are out-of-balance, bent, excessively worn, excessively nicked, or with blade bolts that are excessively worn. Such blades can break loose at high speeds.

> **IMPORTANT:** Replace cutting blades in sets with genuine OEM blades only. Blades must be replaced in sets. Not replacing blades in sets will result in an out-of-balance condition that could contribute to premature bearing wear/breakage and/or structural cracks in gearbox and/or deck.

Always inspect blades before each use. Make certain they are properly installed and in good working condition. Replace any blade that is damaged, worn, bent, or excessively nicked. Never try to straighten a bent blade! Small nicks can be ground out when sharpening.

Remove blades and sharpen or replace as follows:
1. Properly shut down skid steer according to your skid steer Operator's Manual.
2. Secure cutter deck in the up position with solid supports before servicing underside of cutter.
3. Refer to Figure 5-1: Remove blade bolt access cover.
4. Refer to Figure 5-2: Rotate blade bolt (#1) until in alignment with access hole.
5. Unscrew locknut (#5) to remove cutting blade (#2). Blade bolt (#1) is keyed and will not turn freely.
6. Blades should be sharpened at the same angle as the original cutting edge and must be replaced or re-ground at the same time to maintain proper balance in the cutting unit. The following precautions should be taken when sharpening blades:
   a. Do not remove more material than necessary.
   b. Do not heat and pound out a cutting edge.
   c. Do not grind blades to a razor edge. Leave a blunt cutting edge approximately 1/16" thick.
   d. Always grind cutting edge so end of blade remains square to cutting edge and not rounded.
   e. Blades should weigh the same with not more than 1 1/2 oz. difference. Unbalanced blades will cause excessive vibration which can damage gearbox bearings and create structural cracks.
7. > **WARNING**
   > To avoid serious injury or death:
   > A locknut that has been removed can lose its thread locking properties. Reusing a used locknut can result in a thrown blade. Always use a new locknut when installing blades.
8. > **IMPORTANT:** Examine blade bolts, washers, and nuts for excessive wear and replace if worn.
9. Insert blade bolt (#1) through blade (#2), blade carrier (#3) and flat washer (#4). Secure blade with a new locknut (#5).
10. Torque locknut (#5) to 450 ft. lbs.
11. Refer to Figure 5-1: Replace blade bolt access cover.

### Skid Shoe Maintenance

> **WARNING**
> To avoid serious injury or death:
> Excessive wear on skid shoes can damage side panels, cause inadequate operation of cutter, and create a safety hazard. Always replace skid shoes at the first sign of wearing thin.

Skid shoes should be inspected at the beginning of each cutting season and replaced when material thickness is less than 1/8" at any point. Order only genuine Kubota parts from your local Kubota dealer.

Replace skid shoes as follows:
1. Raise the Rotary Cutter 3" or more off the ground and place support blocks under the cutter. Make sure the support blocks are positioned so they will not interfere with skid shoe installation.
2. Lower cutter onto support blocks, place skid steer in park, set park brakes, shut the skid steer off and remove switch key.
3. Remove 3/8" hex nuts (#3), lock washers (#4), flat washers (#5), 3/8" plow bolts (#2) and three skid shoes (#1, 6 & 7) from each side of the deck.
4. Plow bolts should be checked for wear and replaced if necessary.
5. Install the new skid shoes (#1, 6 &7) to one side of the deck as shown with 3/8"-16 GR5 plow bolts (#2), flat washers (#5), lock washers (#4) and 3/8" hex nuts (#3). Tighten nuts to correct torque.
6. Repeat step 5 for other side of the deck.
> **NOTE:** Skid shoe (#6) will be mounted on the front left side of the deck as shown and on the rear right side of the deck. Skid shoe (#7) will be mounted on the rear left side of the deck as shown and on the front right side of the deck.
