## B. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR SERVICING, DISASSEMBLY AND REASSEMBLY

### Safety precautions for servicing
Most accidents during servicing arise from carelessness. Please remember that safety involves both the welfare of the employees and improved work efficiency.

### Safety precautions for disassembly and reassembly
Machines must be disassembled and assembled efficiently and safely. It is very important to thoroughly understand the construction and function of the machine, to make all appropriate preparations, and start operations according to the specified working procedures.

### a. Safety Measures before Starting Work

#### (1) Work clothes
1. Wear specified work cap and clothing. (Under no circumstances may workers wear undershirts only.) Cuffs must be kept buttoned, and any tears must be mended.
2. Wear safety shoes.
3. Do not wear cotton gloves when working on the internal section of engine, reduction gears or hydraulic units for repair or others, or when using a hammer. Wear leather gloves, however, when hoisting wires.

#### (2) Inspecting equipment and tools
1. Prepare equipment (cranes, fork lifts, tools, etc.) required for servicing and inspect for any problems before starting work.
2. Hammer heads (metal parts) must be firmly secured to their handles.
3. Check hoisting tools (wire ropes, hoisting chains, etc.) before use.

#### (3) Keep workshop in order
1. Secure appropriate space needed for disassembly to the job.
2. Secure a clean, safe place for arranging disassembled parts.
3. Store volatile substances (gasoline, light oil, thinner, oily articles, etc.) in appropriate containers at selected locations to prevent fire hazards.

### b. Safety Measures during Work

#### (1) Protectors
1. Wear goggles when using chisels for chipping.
2. Use appropriate protectors during welding.
3. Wear a helmet when working with a crane or at elevated locations.

#### (2) Team work
1. When working with two or more people, divide the work and maintain close communication.
2. Crane work must be carried out using predetermined signals.

#### (3) Disassembly and assembly
1. Do not wear gloves when using hammers.
2. Use rods of the specified soft material for removing pins. Do not use a hammer as a pad.
3. Do not place fingers in holes when centering.
4. Heavy parts must be adequately supported before removing bolts.

#### (4) Cranes
1. In principle, use a crane for objects heavier than 44lb (20kg).
2. Crane operation and hoisting must be performed only by qualified personnel.
3. Pay careful attention to the center of gravity when hoisting, and do not stand under the lifted objects.

#### (5) Others
1. To work under a jacked-up carrier, be sure to place wood pieces under it.
2. When charging batteries, make sure there are no open flames in the immediate vicinity.
3. All electric tools must be grounded.
4. Before welding the machine, remove the battery.
   - When removing the battery, be sure to disconnect negative (-) cord first.
   - When mounting the battery, be sure to connect the positive (+) cord first.

### c. Preparation for Disassembly

#### (1) Cleaning
Remove mud and dirt from the body before disassembly.

#### (2) Acceptance inspection
The machine must be checked before it is disassembled to record existing conditions, such as those listed below.
- Model, serial number, and hourmeter reading
- Reason for repair and repair history
- Element stains
- Fuel and oil condition
- Parts damage *(Take photographs if necessary.)*

#### (3) Equipment and tools
Prepare equipment, tools, cranes and parts storage racks as required.

### d. Precautions for Disassembly and Reassembly

#### (1) Disassembly
1. Follow the specified disassembly procedures.
2. Make alignment marks to insure correct reassembly.
3. Arrange disassembled parts in an orderly way, and attach identification tags or put marks if needed.

#### (2) Reassembly
1. Clean all parts before assembly. Repair any scratches or dents. Take special precautions against dirt and dust.
2. Parts with rust-preventive coatings must be assembled only after removing the coating.
3. Separated parts must be correctly reassembled using alignment marks.
4. As a rule, use a press to reassemble bearings, bushing and oil seals. Use pads when using a hammer.

### e. Maintenance

> **CAUTION**
> **When adding oil and servicing**
> 1. Park the machine on a large, flat place.
> 2. Place the bucket and dozer on the ground.
> 3. Stop the engine.
> 4. Move the attachment control lever and dozer lever to make sure the remaining pressure is relieved. In case of pilot operated models, turn the starter switch to the “ON“ position (1st stage), lift down the safety lock lever and shift both control levers. (Engine doesn't need to start.)
> 5. Pull out the starter key and check around the machine for safety.
> Before starting the job, carefully read the Operational Manual in "Servicing Precautions" on the yellow pages.

### f. Waste Disposal

> **WARNING**
> Do not carelessly throw away and burn the waste materials. Such actions may lead to environmental pollution and punishment by local laws.
> **When disposing of waste:**
> - Let out waste fluid from the machine into a container.
> - Do not let waste fluid flow out on the ground nor into a river, lake, marsh, or sea.
> - Contact your dealer or a qualified industrial waste handler to treat (dispose of or incinerate) harmful waste materials. Those materials include waste oil, fuel, cooling water (anti-freeze), coolant, solvent, filters, batteries, rubber and other toxic substances.

## C. IMPORTANT SAFETY PROCESS AND CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL PROCESS
The following instructions are related to essential adhesives, important safety process **[S]** and critical functional process **[A]**. Pay special attention in servicing these processes. (Pay also close attention in reconnecting the electrical cables.)

### a. Essential Adhesives
**Type of screw adhesive**
- Unless otherwise specified, use Three-Bond 1324 adhesive (medium-duty type).
- Keep the screw threads free of oil and water.

**Type of instantaneous adhesive**
- Use Three-Bond 1733 or Three-Bond 1741E adhesive.
- Keep the bond areas free of oil and water.

### b. Important Safety Process [S]
1. Reconnecting the fuel hose (clearance, hose routes, clamps, etc.)
2. Electrical cabling (engine, instrument panel, controls, etc.) (wiring routes, clamps and couplers)

### c. Important Critical Functional Process [A]
1. Setting up the travel wheel motor (tightening torque)
2. Reassembling the rotary joints (joint direction and shaft set-up)
3. Installing the swivel base bearing and the swivel motor (tightening torque)
4. Fitting the pump couplings (tightening torque)
5. Installing the counter weight.

---

## D. IMPORTANT INSPECTION ITEMS AFTER REASSEMBLING
a. Operate the machine and check for unusual noise and vibrations.
b. Make sure the safety decals and wire harness clamps are in their specified positions.
c. With the machine front in a specified posture, check the amount of hydraulic oil.

**Checking the oil level (For further details, refer to the Operator's Manual of each model.)**

> **CAUTION**
> **To avoid personal injury:**
> - First lower all attachments on the ground then stop the engine.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> - Before filling with oil, wipe away all sand and dust from around the oil port. Make sure you use an identical type of hydraulic fluid.
> - The excavator has been filled with hydraulic fluid before delivery. See "RECOMMENDED OILS". (Do not mix different makes!)

1. Move the excavator on to level ground. Extend every cylinder rod up to its center position, track width increases 2 ft. 9.9 in. (860 mm) and place the bucket in contact with the ground.
2. Check the oil level as to whether it lies on the center mark under normal temperature 50 to 86°F (10 to 30°C).
3. Enough oil is present if the oil level lies between the markings.
4. Should the oil level be too low, fill with oil through the oil port before starting the engine. This step is important for the protection of the hydraulic system.

## E. SERVICING FUNDAMENTALS

### a. Items for Servicing
1. Tighten bolts, nuts, adapters, and similar parts to their specified torques which are given in the list of tightening torques and adhesive as well as in this manual. Be sure to observe the specified torques for important tightened parts and components.
2. Wipe out water, oil and grease off the screws on which loctite adhesive is to be applied. Be sure to apply the adhesive to specified locations.
   - **Types of screw adhesive:**
     - Equivalent to LOCTITE 271 (Heavy-duty)
     - Equivalent to THREE-BOND 1305P (Heavy-duty)
     - Equivalent to THREE-BOND TB1401B (Light-duty)
     - Unless specified otherwise, use THREE-BOND 1324 (Medium-duty).
   - **Type of instantaneous adhesive:**
     - Use THREE-BOND 1733 or 1741E
   *The word "LOCTITE" in this manual denotes the red-color type.*

3. **Precautions in disassembling the hydraulic equipment:**
   - Use a vacuum pump, plugs, oil pans, waste cloth and the like to prevent oil from running out or splashing.
   - Wipe out leaking oil completely first and then add oil as required.
   - Protect the openings with plugs, covers or the like to keep off foreign matters. Most hydraulic system troubles are caused by the entry of foreign matters.
   - Before reassembling, clean up the parts and components and apply hydraulic oil on them.
   - The system consists of precision parts. Be careful not to scratch them and apply excessive force on them.

4. **Precautions in tightening hoses and pipes:**
   - Flexible hoses have a slight natural bend of their own. Utilize the natural bend. Be also careful not to twist them.
   - Be careful not to confuse the routes of the hoses.
   - Do not hold the hoses in tight contact with their adjacent parts and surfaces.
   - **Tightening steps:**
     1. First tighten the nut to its specified torque.
     2. Then loosen the nut by about 45° to fit the seat of the joint to the connection.

5. The quantities of oil, fuel, water and others, except for the oil to be filled in the track rollers and idlers, are listed just as reference. Fill up the fluid up to the specified center level of a level gauge if it is provided.

6. Securely support the machine with a jack and a supporting jig when it is jacked up for servicing.

7. Be sure to use a crane in disassembling and reassembling heavy parts and components (frame, front attachment, crawler, etc.).

### b. O-ring, Oil Seal, Circlip and Roll Pin

#### (1) General precautions
- Make sure the O-ring and the oil seal are free of anything unusual (uneven surface, scratches, chipping, etc.).
- Check the O-ring groove for burrs. Correct, if any, using an oil stone or the like.
- When putting a part past a sharp edge into position, protect such edge with a cover or get the part chamfered.

#### (2) O-ring
- Clean up the O-ring groove and deburr its edge as required.
- Before installing the ring, be sure to apply lubricant (grease) over it. (Do not do this to the floating seal.)
- Fit the O-ring into its groove without twist. With your fingertip, push the ring gently and evenly into the final position. Otherwise the ring would easily get twisted in contact with the inner edge of the groove.

#### (3) Floating seal
- Be sure to wipe oil off the O-ring and the O-ring contact surface. (Note: that oil must be applied thinly over those of the wheel motor.)
- In fitting the O-ring into the floating seal, be careful not to twist the O-ring.
- Before installing the floating seal together with the O-ring, apply sealing oil thinly over the sliding surface. Be careful to keep the sliding surface and O-ring in alignment with the housing.
- Finally turn the floating seal 2 or 3 times by hand in order to form an oil film over the sliding surface as well as to get the sealing surface well fit.

#### (4) Oil seal
- Do not confuse the orientation of the oil seal lips. Direct the main lip toward the oil chamber; in other words, toward what is to be sealed.
  - (a) Packing
  - (b) Metal ring
  - (c) Spring
  - (d) Main lip
  - (e) Oil chamber (inside)
  - (f) Dustproof lip
  - (g) Atmosphere (outside)
  - (h) Grease
- In dry state, the oil seal may wear out when running in the machine. To prevent this, be sure to apply lubricant (grease) over the lip sliding surface. If provided also with a dustproof lip, fill the space between this lip and the main lip with grease.
- As a rule, use a press to press-fit the oil seal. If not available, apply a suitable tool and tap it evenly without allowing any tilt. Press-fit the oil seal deep down to the bottom of the oil seal fitting boss.

#### (5) Mounting the circlip
- Place the circlip with its sharp edge facing outward (in the locking direction).
- Fit the circlip securely in the groove. For the hole circlip in particular, install and turn it slightly to make sure it fits well.

#### (6) Tapping the roll pin (spring pin)
- Place the roll pin (spring pin) with its opening perpendicular to the load.
- Place the roll pin (spring pin) with its opening in the turning direction.
- Evenly tap the roll pin (spring pin) into position.

### c. Piping

#### (1) General precautions
- Tighten the pipe socket to the specified torque. If too tight, the socket itself or a hydraulic component may get damaged. If too loose, an oil leak may occur.
- In connecting a new hose or pipe, tighten its nut first to the specified torque and then turn it back (about 45°). Then tighten it again to the specified torque. (Do not do this to the sealing tape-applied hose or pipe.)
- When disconnecting a vertical hose or pipe, separate its bottom connection first.
- In disconnecting and reconnecting the hose and pipe, be sure to use two wrenches. With one wrench, restrain the mating part to allow no twist.
- Check the mating connector's sleeve and the hose's taper for dust deposits and scratches.
- When the pipe socket has been tightened up, wipe the joint clean. Apply the maximum operating pressure 2 or 3 times to make sure there is no oil leak.

#### (2) Hydraulic hose
Check the hydraulic hose for too tight a connect or twist.
- **Excessively tight contact:** Let's suppose that a hose is in contact with another hose or other part. If the hose is pulled away by a force of 2 kg but still in contact, it means the contact is too tight.

#### (3) Precautions in tightening the bolts and nuts
- Use bolts of specified length.
- Do not over tighten the bolts: Its threads may get deformed or the fixed part may get damaged. Do not under-tighten the bolt either: It may get loose.
- In other words, tighten the bolt to the specified torque.
- Tighten the bolts and nuts diagonally for even tightness.
*(Diagrams illustrate "Top and bottom alternately", "Diagonally", and "Diagonally starting from center" tightening patterns.)*
