## WINDSHIELD KIT (p/n: 77700-V4368)
**Note:** Mount Kit (p/n: 77700-V4310A) is required in order to install this windshield kit.

> **NOTE:** All assembly procedures listed within this manual are generally representative of the machine model for which the manual is written. Your machine may be configured differently, but the outline for the procedure should still be followed. For further support for any issues not covered within the pages of this manual, please contact your local Kubota representative.

2.1. Fig. 2.1 shows the only item included in the windshield kit. Note: inside view of windshield assembly shown.
2.2. Orient the windshield as shown in fig. 2.1. Hook the two upper pins into the receiving slots in the front of the upper mounts (see fig. 2.2). Snap the lower two latches onto the pins on the inside of the front mounts until they are fully engaged. Two (2) clicks means fully engaged. If adjustment is needed, use a 3/16" Allen wrench and a 1/2" open ended wrench to reposition the pin in the slotted front mount.
2.3. Three areas are adjustable if a better seal is desired. First be sure that the upper pins are seated at the bottom of the receiving slots in the upper mounts before beginning any adjustments. The lower latches have adjustment in and out (see fig. 2.3). The lower pins on the front mounts have adjustment up and down. The upper pins have adjustment in all directions due to an oversized hole. Make the necessary adjustments until you achieve "double click" engagement. If the issue is with the seal against the ROPS tubing, adjust the lower latches in or out. If the issue is with the seal against the hood, adjust the pins up or down.
2.4. **Note:** the entire bottom portion of the windshield assembly is designed to pivot up and out of the way when the hood needs to be opened. On each side of the cowl there is a finger pull pin. Disengage and re-engage accordingly. Note: it may be necessary to squeeze the cowl to compress the rubber gasket in order to get the pins to re-engage.
2.5. **Tip:** removal of any component that has latches can be made easier for a single person if the latch is opened to disengage the receiving pin then manually closed as shown in fig. 2.5 so the weight of the component does not cause the latch to continually re-engage on the receiver pin when you try to work the opposite side of the vehicle by yourself. Push at location "c" to close and pull at location "o" to open. Be sure to open latches before re-installing.

### Troubleshooting the windshield

| Condition | Explanation/Solution |

## DOOR KIT (p/n: 77700-11823)
**Note:** Mount Kit (p/n: 77700-V4310A) is required in order to install this door kit.

> **NOTE:** All assembly procedures listed within this manual are generally representative of the machine model for which the manual is written. Your machine may be configured differently, but the outline for the procedure should still be followed. For further support for any issues not covered within the pages of this manual, please contact your local Kubota representative.

5.1. **Note:** the hinge plate mounts shown in figure 5.1 may have already been installed in step 1.3 on page 4 during the mount installation steps. If installing a door kit at a later date than the mount kit, temporarily remove the two bolts and washers shown in figure 5.2. Loosen the bolts on the opposite side, but do not remove them. Orient and install the hinge plate mount as shown. Use caution to avoid cross threading the weldnuts. Start thread engagement by hand. Torque these two bolts to 48-55 N-m, 36-41 ft-lbs, or 4.9-5.7 kgf-m.
5.3. Remove and discard three original equipment plastic pine tree clips (see figure 5.3) from each outboard side of the vehicle floor (shown in figure 5.3.1) and install the supplied floorboards. Position the floorboard in place and fasten using the following hardware: three 1/4-20 x 3/4" long Truss/Phillips head bolts and three 1/4-20 locknuts. Locknuts to be underneath the vehicle. Tighten the bolts.
5.4. Install a door hinge plate to the outside of the rear ROPS tubing as shown in fig. 5.4. Use the following hardware: two 5/16-18 x 1" long button head bolts, four steel flat washers (5/16"), four plastic washers (3/8"), and two locknuts (5/16-18). Locknuts to be on the inside of the cab. See fig. 5.4.1 for placement of plastic washers. Leave bolts loose.
5.5. Fasten the lower portion of the door hinge plate to the hip restraint tube as shown in figure 5.5 using the ROPS U-clamps provided and the following hardware: two 5/16-18 x 1" long button head bolts, four steel flat washers, four plastic washers (3/8"), and two locknuts (5/16-18). Locknuts to be on the inside of the cab. Be sure to orient the U-clamp so that the angle of the clamp is aligned with the angle of the ROPS hip restraint tube that it fastens to. See fig. 5.4.1 for placement of plastic washers. Leave bolts loose.
**NOTICE:** The Restriction Plate on the Door Hinge Plate as shown in fig 5.5.1 (Driver's side only) is designed to prevent assembly onto the RTV 500. Do not remove or alter this plate.
5.6. Align rear edge of door hinge plate parallel with vertical ROPS tube. Tighten all four bolts.
5.7. Repeat for passenger's side.
5.8. Open the front portion of the sliding window on each door to keep from being locked out of the cab.
5.9. Apply grease to the factory installed pin hinges and install the doors by lining up the pin hinges on the door with the hinge sleeves on the door hinge plate. Work the doors back and forth until they are completely seated on the pin hinges.
5.10. Close the door fully and determine if the door is approximately centered to the ROPS tubing. If necessary, loosen the pin hinges on the door and adjust as necessary. Hinge holes are oversized for adjustment in all directions. Re-tighten the pin hinge bolts.
5.11. Adjust the acorn nut and jam nut on the door handle plunger shown in figure 5.11 so that the plunger is as short as it can be. Use two 13mm wrenches. Further adjustment will be made in a later step.
5.12. The striker bolt on the front mount can be adjusted up or down. The inside rotary latch on the door can be adjusted front to back and in and out. Continue to adjust the engagement as necessary until you get the door to fully seal and close with "two" audible clicks which is confirmation that the door is fully closed and secure enough to drive. The latch should engage smoothly on the pin. If contacting the top or bottom of the pin, adjust the pin in the slot to avoid excessive pin wear. If the pin is at the bottom of the slot during engagement, move it to the top of the slot, loosen the u-bracket on the rear leg, and close the door so that two clicks are heard. Re-tighten the u-bracket without opening the door. Once tight, open the door and re-adjust the pin in the slot.
5.13. Any or all of the following four areas can be adjusted for proper "double click" engagement: standard striker pin, inside rotary latch, door pin hinges, and/or the hinge sleeves.
5.14. Once the latch is properly adjusted for "double click" engagement, adjust the acorn nut so that it just misses the release on the latch with 1 mm (1/32") clearance. Tighten the jam nut against the acorn nut to prevent it from loosening.

### Troubleshooting the door

| Condition | Explanation/Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Latches will not double click | Move latches in. |
| Latch and pin does not line up (up and down) | Move pin up or down. Loosen hinges and lower or raise the front of the door. |
| Latch and pin does not line up (front to back) | Move latch forwards or backwards. Loosen hinges and move door forwards or backwards. |
| Door does not seal | Move latch out. |

### IMPORTANT CLEANING INFORMATION

Keep the enclosure components clean in order to prevent dust and dirt from forming an unattractive film. The life of your windows, doors, and roof panels depends upon following these care procedures:

#### WINDOWS:
1) **NEVER USE** AN ALCOHOL-BASED PRODUCT FOR CLEANING. Do not use **WINDEX, GLASS PLUS, FANTASTIC**, etc. Use of these products will result in deterioration of the windows.
2) Wash with a mild soap or detergent using your bare hands to free or dislodge any caked-on dirt or other foreign particles.
3) A soft, grit-free cloth, sponge, or chamois may be used but only as a means of carrying water to the windows.
4) The interior should be lightly dusted (NOT WIPED) with a clean soft cloth or chamois. The cloth or chamois should be kept free of grit by frequent rinsing in clean water.
5) Grease and oil may be removed with kerosene.
6) Novus I and Novus II are recommended plastic cleaners and can be used to remove light scratches.

#### DOORS AND ROOF PANELS:
1) **NEVER USE** AN ABRASIVE DETERGENT/VEHICLE CLEANER OR A WIRE BRISTLED BRUSH. Do not use any **CITRUS BASED CLEANERS** such as orange or lemon. Use of these products will cause the plastic to become permanently damaged.
2) Clean the plastic enclosure surfaces thoroughly with warm soapy water and a COTTON cloth or chamois. Be sure to use mild soap, specifically a dish liquid or equivalent. Clean in a light circular motion for best results.
3) Use EXTRA CAUTION when cleaning the interior of the enclosure. The interior is more sensitive than the exterior because the exterior has an extra coating for U.V. stability.
4) Remove grease and oil with mineral spirits and a COTTON cloth or chamois.
