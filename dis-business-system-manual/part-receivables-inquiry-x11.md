APPLY CREDITS

### Introduction

The purpose of this job is to allow you to merge payments (credits) with their
corresponding invoices (debits) and to change the number of days for calculating
interest for a particular invoice.

If you have entered receivables credits in Create Source Documents (X1-7) or
Point Of Sale Invoicing (X5-1), you will merge them with the corresponding
debits. If you enter all your payments from the Enter Payments (X1 1-5), you will
use this option to merge the debits and credits.

Note: The merge applies to all customers regardless of their “Statement Type”
(“O” = Open Item, or “B” = Balance Forward). This code determines how
transactions display on the statement. Credit and debit processing is exactly the
same for these two statement types.

Screen D: Change Days Of Interest - Customer Selected

This screen allows you to change the number of days used for calculating the
interest for a particular invoice. When you calculate the interest from the option
Calculate And Post Interest (X11-9), the system will determine the number of
days for calculating interest in the following order:
1. Transaction, as specified in the “Days Interest” field in Apply Credits
(X11-4)
2. Customer, as specified in “Number Of Days To Charge Interest” field in
Receivables Maintenance (X11-2)
3. Division, as specified in “Days Before Int” field in Security Maintenance
(X6-6) for all the receivables
4. Ifall these fields are blank, the default will be 30 days.

Transactions set to not charge interest for 999 days will be considered
“permanently current" and will never age regardless. The number of days until
interest begins can be set for the division in Security Maintenance, for the
customer in Receivables Maintenance, and for a particular transaction in Apply
Credits. See also Receivables OPTs. Otherwise, even though interest charges are
Postponed, transactions age normally. You might want to keep this in mind when
you compose messages that appear on statements. Aging cannot be changed.

## CHAPTER X11-5

ENTER PAYMENTS

### Introduction

As the name indicates, Enter Payments is used to record accounts receivable
payments (checks), and other cash receipts and post them directly to the general
ledger You can also post write-offs directly to any number of general ledger
accounts as long as their edit codes are blank or "B." You can post discounts and
adjustments, and, in addition, the cash receipts feature allows you to post to other
accounts with edit codes, such as Accounts Payable (trade and flooring),
inventory, and scheduled accounts. Posting corrections are interactive (show up
on the screen as you make them). Regular Received on Account payments and
various cash receipts can be handled in the same batch.

Prior to entering payments for the first time, run Configure Payments (X11-6). It
will be easier to understand Enter Payments after you are introduced to Configure
Payments; therefore, these options will be discussed together in Configure
Payments (X11-6). The receipt types, accounts receivable payments, general
ledger levels, and the other default information are set up in Configure Payments.

### Warning!

Post payments before exiting or all payments entered will be lost.

## CHAPTER X11-6

CONFIGURE PAYMENTS

### Introduction

The purpose of this job is to allow you to customize your payments. Under this
option you are able to set up receipt types, set up accounts receivable payments,
and set up levels in the general ledger. These defaults are in Enter Payments
(X11-5). It will be easier to understand Enter Payments after you have been
introduced to Configure Payments, therefore, in this chapter, these two options
will be discussed together.

DIS recommends that you post all cash and check receipts into a Cash on Hand
account during the day and transfer the total from Cash on Hand to Cash in Bank
when you make your daily deposit. This facilitates bank reconciliation because
there is just one transaction per day instead of the line-by-line detail.

### Accounts Receivable Payments C

Accounts Receivable payments can be handled by customer address numbers and
matched to the corresponding invoices, which creates the cross reference Invoices
Paid By This Payment illustrated on page 7 and Payments Applied To This
Invoice illustrated on page 7. One check can be applied to one invoice per batch.
These payments are merged automatically. Unapplied credits can be posted, then
merged with an appropriate charge in a later batch.

 

Note
If a customer pays the unposted interest printed on a statement, post the unapplied
credit, then make a journal entry to post the interest. Use Apply Credits to merge
the payment with the interest.

 

The examples in this section will follow an Accounts Receivable payment from
beginning to end beginning with Configure Payments, where you’ ll find 3 options:

1-Receipt Types
2-A.R. Payments
3-Levels (optional). The system is shipped with the following levels which will be
sufficient: (
Level 1
Level 99

Levels refer to the amount of detail you want on the debit to the general ledger.
Level | generates only 1 debit, which is the total of all the credit lines whereas
Jevel 99 generates | line for each credit line. Level 99 is “hard-coded” and does
not have to be set up.

The second option, A.R. Payments, is where you provide the defaults that will be
used in Enter Payments if you start with a customer address number. A.R.
payments to a different bank or cash account can be handled easily by changing
the A.R. payment screen, which is illustrated below:

The purpose of this job is to allow you to enter warranty payments and to apply
them to the corresponding claims. You can also enter transactions to adjust the
differences between claim amounts and payment receipts or credits.

 

Note
You can process payments for a single warrantor per batch.

You may process payments for different claims from the warrantor who was

configured in Configure Warranty Payments (X1 1-8). You can also process claims
for other warrantors; however, there will be no default information for them.

Automatic Adjustment

There are different ways to enter discount or adjustment amounts on documents.
You can enter amounts for each of the transactions, or you can enter a single
amount for all of the transactions. The [Cmd16] - Automatic Adjustment key can
help you in completing the task. Here is information on the results of using
automatic adjustment and manual adjustment for different situations:

1. The total amount paid is equal to the unpaid amount of the claim (Diff. = 0).
O [Cmdi6]: Without entering the amount, press [Cmd16]. The system
applies the unpaid amount of the claim automatically to the first “Claim #”

line available. You do not have to press [Cmd3] - Return, to leave this
claim.

O Manually: Enter the amounts paid in the “Claim #” fields and press
[Enter]. The payment is applied to the claim. To leave this claim, press
[Cmd3] - Return.

2. The total amount paid is different from the unpaid amount of the claim.

O [Cmd16]: Enter the amounts paid in the “Claim #” fields without entering
the discount/adjustment. Press [Cmd16]. The system calculates the
difference between the unpaid amount of the claim and the total amount
paid, adjusts the total amount paid to the unpaid amount of the claim and
puts the difference in the discount/adjustment field. To leave this claim,
press [Cmd3} - Retum.

Manually: Enter the amounts requested in the “Claim #” fields and enter
the differences in the “Dis/Adj.” fields. To record the information, press
[Enter]. To leave this claim, press [Cmd3] - Return.

3. Transactions are not all paid by this warranty payment.

CO) If the manufacturer pays less than the claim, you have to manually enter
the amounts and discounts/adjustments for the transactions that are paid.
Also, the discount/adjustment can only be entered at the time of the full
payment of the claim. At this point, you will be able to use the [Cmd16] -
Automatic Adjustment key.

Note: During an automatic adjustment with amounts that you have entered (option
2, above), the system verifies the “ Maximum Difference To Adjust
Automatically” that was set up in Configure Warranty Payments (X11-8). If the
difference to be adjusted exceeds this amount, you will receive an error message
telling you than the automatic adjustment can not be made. You can then enter the
adjustment manually. This verification insures that when the adjustment exceeds


16 X11-7 e ENTER WARRANTY PAYMENTS RELEASE 2.1

the maximum for automatic adjustment, you are made aware of the adjustment

amount.

C To record the payment of this document, and return to the Accounts

with the oldest, press [Cmd16] - Automatic Adjustment.

## CHAPTER X11-9

CALCULATE AND POST INTEREST

### Introduction

The purpose of this job is to allow you to calculate and post interest to your

receivables. During this procedure, interest will be calculated for:

~ all invoices whose age is over the limit set up in the “Days Before Int” field,
under the Security and Configuration Menu (X6-6). The limit set up in the
Security and Configuration Menu is the default for all customer invoices.

— invoices for specific customers over the limit set up in their “Number Of Days
To Charge Interest” field under Receivables Maintenance (X1 1-2)

— specific invoices that are over the limit set up in the “Days Interest” field
under Apply Credits (X11-4)

Interest calculated by the system is displayed onscreen and can be changed before
it is posted. The amount of interest can not be greater than the balance due. If a
customer owes less than the minimum interest charge, you’ll have to change the
amount of interest to be less than or equal to the balance due.

Interest will not be calculated for customers having “N” in the “Charge Interest”

field under Receivables Maintenance (X11-2) or for an invoice with the value
“999” in the “Days Interest” field under Apply Credits (X11-4).

NOTE

The only way to calculate and post interest to all receivables accounts is from the
Calculate and Post Interest option. Make sure it has been run before printing
statements.

### Understanding Interest Calculations

The purpose of this section is to explain how interest is calculated and suggest
ways you can make it work effectively for your business.

Transactions are aged in real time, meaning that if you allow a 30-day grace
period, a transaction is current until the 31st day after it is created. Interest is
charged for the whole month on transactions that will be over their allotted
number of days as of the end of the month.

Example I. A transaction (T) charged on May 28 is still current (less than 30
days) on June 25, but it will be over 30 days old on June 30. If you calculate and
post interest (I), then run statements (S) on June 25, interest will be charged on a
current transaction for the entire month of June when it appears on the customer's
statement for the first time.

|21__ [227 [a3 [ea [asus [26 [a7 |
[28 [29 30

        

If you don't want this to happen, but you want to continue running statements on
the 25th, you can change “Days Before Int” field in Security Maintenance (X6-6)
to a number higher than 30. The number will be based on the day you actually run
statements: 30 (Number of days in month)-25 (Day you charge interest)=6
(Difference); 30 (Current setting) + 5 (Difference) = 35 (New setting).

In the example above, with 35 days before interest is charged, the 5/28 transaction
will be current until July 1, and no interest will be charged on June 25.


4 X11-9 e CALCULATE AND POST INTEREST RELEASE 2.2

This setting can be changed as often as you like so it can accommodate February {
and months with 31 days. Don't forget that "Number of Days to Charge Interest"

can be changed on the customer's master record (Receivables Maintenance X11-2)

and at the invoice level in Apply Credits (X11-4).

Example 2. A transaction (T) charged on May 1 is still current (less than 30 days)
on May 25, and it will still be current on May 31. If you calculate and post interest
(J), then run statements (S) on May 25, no interest will be charged.

The 5/1 transaction falls into the 30-day category on June 4. If the transaction is
paid (P) on June 24, the customer will not be charged any interest when it is
calculated on June 25. In this case, the customer has enjoyed 20 additional
interest-free days. However, if the transaction has not been paid when interest is
calculated on June 25, interest will be charged for the entire month of June.

A strategy adopted by some dealers is to establish a due date, such as the 10th of
the month. It is clearly indicated on the customer's statement that they must pay by
the 10th to avoid interest charges. On the 11th, interest (I) is calculated and posted
even though statements (S) are not printed until the 25th.

### - Calculate And Post Interest 5

In this case, the 5/1 transaction that is paid (P) on the 24th is still charged interest
(X) for the month of June on the statement (S) that is printed on the 25th.

Remember to calculate and post interest only once a month! On the selection
screen, which is illustrated below, make sure you are calculating interest for the
current month only. In the example, note that interest was last calculated on
3/25/98. It is now 6/25/98. If you indicate that you want to calculate interest for a
future month by entering 0798, interest will be calculated for 2 full months on
every transaction. If you make a mistake, (you'll notice that the interest is too
high), press Cmd1-End from the Update Interest screen. Do not post the batch
unless you enjoy making corrections!

PRINT STATEMENTS

### Introduction

‘You can print statements at any time, more than once a month, if desired. When
you print statements, current transactions for balance forward customers are
moved to the balance forward total for the next billing. If you don’t want to
change current transactions so that they will be printed on the next statement, run
Interim/Past Due Statements (X11-11) instead. To calculate and Post interest, ran
Calculate And Post Interest (X11-9).

Customers can be selected by general ledger account (all receivables, or up to ten
individual accounts), group code, or address number (all, or up to ten individual
customers).

‘You can choose to print non-posted interest on the statements (optional). If you
choose to print unposted interest, it is included in the total balance due on
statements. If a customer pays the unposted interest from their statement, post the
unapplied credit, then make a journal entry to post the interest. Use Apply Credits
to merge the payment with the interest. If you rn Calculate & Post Interest (X11-
9) and then say “Yes to print unposted interest for the same general ledger period,
you will have double interest on that month's statement. Printing unposted interest
is a way to handle customers who don't pay interest but you wish they would. Deal
with it if they pay instead of having to back it out if they don't.

Print Statements will display all transactions since the last time Print Statements
was run for both balance forward and open item statements. For balance forward
Statements, payments listed on the previous statement will be applied to previous
invoices and the unpaid balance will appear as the balance forward total. For open
item statements, payments listed on the previous statement will be applied to
previous invoices and unpaid transactions will be listed as open items.

If you want to reprint a statement exactly like the one a customer received, contact
your DIS Marketing Representative about Archiving.

The prompt, “Calculate non-posted interest,” refers to whether you want to
calculate and print interest that has not been posted. It can be used to calculate
interest for the next month: the G/L Period (MMYY) refers to the month you want
to calculate interest for. Remember interest is always calculated for an entire
month. You’ ll want to coordinate the number of days before interest is charged,
the date you actually post interest, and the date for printing statements with non-
posted interest.

For example, you might decide to age accounts and post interest on the 20th of
each month and delay printing statements until the 25th. To let customers know
that you expect payment by the 20th and that they will be charged interest if they
delay payment, you can have next month’s interest calculated and printed on their
statements. You won’t actually post the interest until the 20th of the next month;
however, the interest will be added to the total balance due as if it had been
posted. If a customer pays the interest before it has been posted, you can either
credit their account or make a journal entry to post the interest charge.

    
  

### Warning

   

If you choose to print unposted interest, it is included in the total balance due on
statements. If a customer pays the unposted interest from their statement, post the
unapplied credit, then make a journal entry to post the interest. Use Apply Credits
to merge the payment with the interest. If you run Calculate & Post Interest (X11-
9) and then say "Yes" to print unposted interest for the same general ledger
period, you will have double interest on that month's statement. Printing unposted
interest is a way to handle customers who don't, pay interest but you wish they
would. Deal with it if they pay instead of having to back it out if they don't.

 
       
 
         

O To calculate interest to print on statements, type ¥ in the “Calculate non-
posted interest” field. This interest will not be posted to your customer
accounts. The only way to post interest in Receivables is from the option
Calculate And Post Interest (X11-9).

0 If you choose to calculate interest here, in the “Interest Transactions (non-
posted)” field, enter the document number, the description for interest
transactions, and the general ledger month for the calculation of interest.
INTEREST is the default document number. The description is optional. In
the “G/L Period” field, enter-the general ledger month for calculating the
interest in the format MMYY (month, year). You can print for any period. To
print statements for the current month, leave this field blank.

Forms alignment is not an exact science: printers of the same make and model
may be calibrated differently. Your own printer won't maintain the same
alignment forever. As any mechanic can tell you, anything with moving parts
changes!

Even on the same printer, it helps to think about forms alignment as a process, not
something that you do right the first time every time. The most important part of
the process is to become comfortable with the system messages and how to
answer them.

In general the process goes like this:
O Load the forms.

O Print the first line. Make adjustment.


14 X11-10 ¢ PRINT STATEMENTS RELEASE 2.2
Fy eS 22

C) Print the first line again. Make adjustment. Repeat this step until you are pretty (
sure you have the alignment OK. On the AS/400, you do not have the option
to print one line at a time. Your choices are to print the same line on the same
form, print the same line on the next form, or print the next line and continue
without further messages. You don’t ever want to cancel the print job. Of
course, with pre-printed checks you don’t even want to skip to the next form,
so your choices are even more limited.

C Let them print! If you need to make another minor adjustment, take the
printer off-line temporarily. It will resume exactly where it left off when you
put it back on-line. If you have a forms jam or other semi-catastrophe, see the
section "What Can Go Wrong & What To Do” in the Appendix chapter that
applies to your printer.

Q Remove the special forms and reload standard paper.

Each step is controlled through system messages and your answers to them.
Following the instructions about physical alignment will help you get started;
however, you'll need to figure out what works best on your printer and mark the
diagrams accordingly.

### System Messages (

The DIS Business System recognizes 4 different forms for the system printer:

Form System Abbreviation
1. Standard STD or 0001

2. Checks CHKS

3. Statements STAT

4. Labels LAB

5. Letters LETT

The stock paper used for reports is called "Standard," whether it is wide bar or 8
1/2" X 11" letter-size. To prevent your accidentally printing important things like
checks on standard paper, or reports on expensive forms such as checks, the
system always lets you know when it is time to change forms.

System messages tell you when to load special forms, such as statements, and
when to reload regular standard paper; however, it must depend on your answers
to the messages to “know” what kind of forms are currently in the printer. In
addition, when your answer indicates that forms have been changed, the system


ACCOUNTING X11-10 « PRINT STATEMENTS 15
ET AT EMENTO UN

provides a message to facilitate alignment. In its own clunky mechanical way, it is
trying to make your job easier.

Although there seem to be dozens of messages the first time you try to align -
forms, there are really only 2 different messages: .
- Load Forms, which comes at the beginning and end of a job that requires
different forms.
«Alignment, which can be repeated as often as necessary.

Your success depends on having the forms almost right when you answer the
Load Forms message and then controlling adjustments through the Alignment
message.

When you run a job that requires a change of forms, look at the AS/400's “Work
with Printer Output” screen. At any DIS menu, type: D P [Enter]. The screen is
illustrated below. In the example, messages for Past Due Statements (XI 1-9) is
illustrated.

The Load Forms message, CPA3394, is the first message and it occurs once at the

stock paper out of the printer and put statements in or vice versa. The possible
answers to this message are:
H= Hold
C =Cancel
G= Go. Answer with a '"G" after the specified forms (statements) are loaded.
This is the answer you'll use most of the time. It signals the computer

" after the specified

A COMMON MISTAKE is to take out the statements and reload-standard paper ~
before this message is received. The same problem arises when standard forms are
removed and special forms loaded before the Load Forms message.

it then seems logical to answer the Load Forms message with an "I," which means
you don't want to change forms and that you want to continue on the current
forms. The trouble is that now you think "current forms" are standard but the
system still thinks "current forms" are checks or statements.

If you find yourself in this situation, to change the forms number and restart the
print job, follow the instructions in the section “What Can Go Wrong & What To
Do” in the Appendix chapter that applies to your printer.

THE BEST PROCEDURE is:
O Don't do anything until you receive the Load Forms message.

## CHAPTER X11-11

PRINT INTERIM/PAST DUE STATEMENTS

### Introduction

The purpose of this job is to allow you to print interim or past due statements for
selected receivables. You can print Interim/Past Due Statements at any time.
Current transactions (activity since the most recent regular statement) will be
listed. Customers can be selected based on the Number of Days That Make
Collection Critical, which is set up by customer in Receivables Maintenance
(X11-2). The Aged Receivables Collection Report, which shows trending
information, is also based on the same field.

Print Interim/Past Due Statements will display all transactions since the last time
Print Statements (X11-10) was run for both balance forward and open item
Statement types. Print Interim/Past Due Statements can be run repeatedly without
affecting the status of transactions in accounts. Current transactions will not be
merged into balance forward and will appear as current transactions the next time
Print Statements is run.

To calculate and post interest, run Calculate And Post Interest (X11-9). To print
Statements in your regular cycle, run Print Statements (X11-10).

If you want to reprint a statement exactly like the one a customer received, contact
your DIS Marketing Representative about Archiving.

customers. Only address numbers in the receivables file are used for letters. A list
of outstanding invoices in any aging category may be attached as an appendix to
any letter. Although variables, such as names and addresses, even balances, may

The symbolic variables allow you to merge your customer fields in your
letters. You must reserve the appropriate number of characters needed for
the printing of these fields. Each available variable is listed with its
corresponding length, the "@xx" is part of the length to reserve,

X11-12 e LETTERS MAINTENANCE 7

Using Variables

In the column labeled “Lgth,” you'll find the number of spaces you need to allow
for the variable, such as Name, which has a length of 28 characters. The 3
character variable, such as @01, is included in the length you need to reserve. For
example, reserve exactly 8 spaces for a date, not 8+ 3 =11.

Names

To print the customer's name after “Dear” leave | space after “Dear” and then
type the code, which is @01. The line will look like this:
Dear @01

There must be 25 blank spaces after the @01. Because not every name will take
the allotted 28 characters, don't include a colon (:) at the end or you'll end up with
something that looks like this:

Dear Gerry Parker

Dollar Amounts

If you want to include balances, you may want to include dollar signs.

Here is a line that will include a balance:
Your current balance, which is $@09 , Must be
paid before we can extend credit privileges again.

The result:
Your current balance, which is $57.33 , Must be
paid before we can extend credit privileges again.

Again, there is a problem with punctuation following the variable.

Dates

Dates are easier, because their length is dependable.
Pay within 30 days of today, @18

The result:
Pay within 30 days of today, 8/07/97.
Avoiding Punctuation

Wherever you have a variable that may not be as long as the space allowed, try to
arrange your sentences so that it is at the end and omit the punctuation.
