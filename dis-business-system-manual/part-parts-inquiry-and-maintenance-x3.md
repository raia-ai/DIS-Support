PARTS INQUIRY

### Introduction

Parts Inquiry allows you to search for and view Parts are in your inventory and to
use communications to inquire on parts from the manufacturer. You can also view
part information supplied in the manufacturer's price book for parts not in your
inventory, and equivalent parts from Bearing Interchange. This job is inquiry
only. To make changes, use X3-2, PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE,
Major features (such as Cores, Quantity Break Pricing, Cross-referencing),
pricing and availability, and field definitions can be found in CHAPTER X3-2,
PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE,

 

NOTE
Command keys and Function keys are the same. The S/36 environment uses
[Cmd); the AS/400 uses [F].

From Point of Sale (X5-1), [Cmd23] comes directly to Parts Inquiry. The

Information screen for the part number on the detail line, if any, is displayed.
Parts cannot be retrieved from Parts Inquiry back to Point of Sale.

You may search by part number by entering a text string after the "?". Example:
In the part number field, enter 7410094. Except that the text string begins with a
"2" the resulting search would be equivalent to a search by part number described
below.

Positional search by part number

Once the Parts Search Window is displayed, you can perform a search by part
number by entering a text string and press [Enter]. You will be positioned in the
Parts Index to the first part that begins with text string you just entered. This is
called a positional search.

Non-positional text search

Alternately, if you precede the text string with a"*" the computer will display all
parts that contain the text string you entered in any position. For example "*10"
would find 10551, 911002, and, 6510. This is called a non-positional search.

Search by description

You may also perform a search by description. This works in the same way as the
parts search, except you press {Cmd5] instead of [Enter] after the text string has
been keyed in.

Bearing Interchange

By using a pound sign in the part number field along with any bearing number
(such as #689), you can search for a replacement in the Bearing Interchange
Catalog. Screens are illustrated in CHAPTER X7-9, Bearing Interchange Menu.

### Sales History Screen

The information on the Sales History Screen is updated by transactions at Point of
Sale and by transactions from the Transaction Screen at Parts Posting &
Maintenance. Sales History is automatically updated when Parts End of Day is
run. It can be updated manually when you are adding parts to your DIS inventory
for which you already have some history. See Chapter X3-2, PARTS POSTING
AND MAINTENANCE.

Sales History is kept by the system for 3 years. When Parts End of Year is run,
the system gets rid of all history over 24 months and leaves room for the new
year. This is something to remember when you request a phase-out or sales return
based on history.

Sales: A sale of 5 widgets to one person is recorded as | call, 5 pieces.

Lost Sales: A lost sale where one person wanted 5 widgets is recorded as 1 call
and 5 pieces. The only difference in the way lost sales are recorded is where they
are summarized on the Parts Management Report (X36-2) where there is a special
category, "Lost sales”.

The Sales History Screen looks like this:

### Supersession Screen

 

The Supersession screen shows a forward supersession chain for the part. If
supersession information is in the price book, the information is added to the part
record when the part is added to inventory. The supersession information can also
be added manually at Parts Posting and Maintenance (X3- 2).

Only the parts forward in the chain will display on the screen. For example, ABC
Company began with a MAN part of A1250. It was superseded by A1251. A1251
was superseded by A1252 and A1252 was superseded by A1253.

Part Number Superseded by

A1250 A1251
Al251 A1252
A1252 A1253

If inquiring on A1250, ABC Company would display the full chain forward. The
screen would contain A1251, Al252, and A1253. If the inquiry was on A1252,
only A1253 would display. Below is a sample of the Supersession screen:

### Remanufactured Parts

New parts reference the remanufactured (reman) part. Reman parts show prices of
the reman part and its primary core and reference the primary core part number.
Primary cores reference alternate cores, if any. For more information on reman
parts, see chapter X38-1, CONFIGURE VENDOR/CLASS.

### Supersession

Supersession information is available in the following options:
- Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

- Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

- Display/Print/Change Price Book (X37-3)

- Point of Sale Detail Line (X5-1)

- Part Availability (Cmd12 from X5-1)

- Electronic Parts Catalogs

Except for Display/Print/Change Price Book (X37-3) and Electronic Parts
Catalogs, backward supersession is not handled. The DIS system attempts to sell
all parts from inventory in a forward chain and displays the last part in the chain
so it can be ordered, if necessary. The Electronic Parts Catalog skips intermediate
parts and displays only 1 level of backward and 1 level of forward supersession
(the last part in the chain).

Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

The Supersede code "S” means the part has been superseded by a single part. "M"
means the part has been superseded by multiple parts, only the first
(alphabetically) is displayed. This information is updated by price tape update.
Parts In Inventory

If the entire chain is in inventory, it is displayed at F7=Supersession when the
original part number is entered. If a superseding part is entered, the chain is
displayed from that part forward. You must press F5=Division to check
availability for a part in other divisions.

Parts Not In Inventory

If the original part number is entered, the chain is revealed from the price book

one number at a time in a message at the bottom of the screen. If a superseding
part is entered, the chain is displayed from that part forward.


22 X3-1 ¢ PARTS INQUIRY RELEASE 2.3
ee SeSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSIEERASE 25

Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2) C

Parts In Inventory

Supersession information can be added to any part manually. This is overwritten
when inventory is updated from a price tape or price book unless the part is ina
class flagged as non-updateable (automatic pricing = N) in Configure
Vendor/Class (X38-1). In the absence of a price book, this information is used by
POS to chain to superseding parts.

Parts Not In Inventory

Parts may be added from the price book from any point in a chain. No
supersession information is retrieved, only pricing and the return code. There is
no way to know how many superseding parts there are or to go directly to the end
of the chain.

Display/Print Price Book (X37-3)

The price book displays backward (supersedes) and forward (superseded by)
chains. The "M" indicator seems to mean the part supersedes many different parts
and does not correspond to the "M" indicator used in Parts Posting &
Maintenance, which means the part is superseded by multiple parts (kit).

Point of Sale Detail Screen

Point of Sale uses both local inventory and the price book to sell the first available
part in a forward chain, and always displays the last part number in the chain, A
part that has been superseded by multiple parts shows simply *MULTIPLE*.

Part In Inventory

Availability information is displayed. If the request cannot be filled by the first
part entered, the next part in the chain with available quantity will be displayed on
the comment line. After all available parts have been sold, the last part in the
chain can be ordered.

Part Not in Inventory

Regardless of where you start in a chain, the last part in the chain is displayed on
the comment line. If it is not possible to order the part you enter, such as AA1117,
you will receive an “Invalid part” message, and the most current part will be
displayed on the comment line. If it is possible to order the part you entered, it
will be displayed on the detail line with a "P" priority code, but the most current
part number will be displayed on the comment line.

Part in Inventory
All superseding parts in the chain that are in inventory are displayed whether they
will be needed to meet the request or not.

Part Not In Inventory

Part Availability searches local inventory, other divisions, and the price book. All
parts in the forward supersession chain will be displayed. If the original part
requested is in the requesting division's inventory but not available, it will show
"NOT OK.” Parts located in the price book will be indented and show "NOT
OK/PRC BOOK." If you left-justify the parts and press [Enter] again, the system
will search other divisions for the superseding part and display availability
information. You will be able to order the last part in the chain, if necessary. The
system will repeat the quantity, which is adjusted manually as you decide what
parts to sell.

Electronic Parts Catalog

As of 11/5/96, the DIS interface to the parts catalog displays 1 level of backward
supersession and the last part(s) in the forward chain (1 level). If the parts listed
are in the dealer's inventory, availability and bin location are displayed. No
intermediate parts are shown, regardless of whether the part is in the dealer's local
inventory or not. Multiple "Superseded by” part numbers indicate a kit. Multiple
"Supersedes" may be from a kit to one part or simply separate parts that have
been superseded by the same part.

Multiple supersession is the most difficult because manufacturers do not make it
clear whether a part is superseded by 3 different single parts or by a kit consisting
of 3 parts. In some cases, the original part number is superseded by several
different part numbers, any one of which can be used to replace the original part.
In other cases, the original part is superseded by a kit composed of several
different part numbers, all of which are required to do the job of the 1 original
part number. In either case, the DIS Business System displays "*MULTIPLE*" in
the "Super." field at Point of Sale. If possible, use the comment field on the Parts
Posting & Maintenance screen to store all part numbers that are required for
supersession.

 

Stand-alone parts catalogs (without the DIS interface) display only the last part(s)
in a forward supersession chain.

## CHAPTER X3-1

PARTS INQUIRY

### Introduction

Parts Inquiry allows you to search for and view parts that are in your
inventory. You can also view part information supplied in the
manufacturer's price book for parts not in your inventory, and equivalent
parts from Bearing Interchange. This job is inquiry only. To make
changes, use X3-2, PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE..

Major features (such as Cores, Quantity Break Pricing, Cross-
referencing), pricing and availability, and field definitions can be found in

## CHAPTER X3-2

## , PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE. These are the

options within Parts Inquiry:

F1-End job

F2-Information

F3-History

F4-Orders

F5-Division

NOTE

 
 

Command keys and Function keys are the same. The S/36
environment uses [Cmd]; the AS/400 uses [F].

 

From Point of Sale (X5-1), [Cmd23] comes directly to Parts Inquiry. The
Information screen for the part number on the detail line, if any, is

displayed. Parts cannot be retrieved from Parts Inquiry back to Point of
Sale.


[| X3-1 PARTS INQUIRY Cc

### Supersession

Supersession information is available in the following options:
- Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

- Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

- Display/Print/Change Price Book (X37-3)

- Point of Sale Detail Line (X5-1)

- Part Availability (Cmd12 from X5-1)

- Electronic Parts Catalogs

Except for Display/Print/Change Price Book (X37-3) and Electronic Parts
Catalogs, backward supersession is not handled. The DIS system attempts

to sell all parts from inventory in a forward chain and displays the last part

in the chain so it can be ordered, if necessary. The Electronic Parts Catalog (
skips intermediate parts and displays only 1 level of backward and 1 level

of forward supersession (the last part in the chain).

Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

The Supersede code "S" means the part has been superseded by a single
part. "M" means the part has been superseded by multiple parts, only the
first (alphabetically) is displayed. This information is updated by price
tape update.

Parts in Inventory

If the entire chain is in inventory, it is displayed at F7=Supersession when
the original part number is entered. If a superseding part is entered, the
chain is displayed from that part forward. You must press F5=Division to
check availability for a part in other divisions.

RELEASE 2.2 NN


X3-1 PARTS INQUIRY [=]

Parts Not In inventory

If the original part number is entered, the chain is revealed from the price
book one number at a time in a message at the bottom of the screen. If a
superseding part is entered, the chain is displayed from that part forward.

Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

Parts In Inventory

Supersession information can be added to any part manually. This is
overwritten when inventory is updated from a price tape or price book
unless the part is in a class flagged as non-updatable (automatic pricing =
N) in Configure Vendor/Class (X38-1). In the absence of a price book, this
information is used by POS to chain to superseding parts.

Parts Not In Inventory

Parts may be added from the price book from any point in a chain. No
supersession information is retrieved, only pricing and the return code.
There is no way to know how many superseding parts there are or to go
directly to the end of the chain.

Display/Print Price Book (X37-3)

The price book displays backward (supersedes) and forward (superseded
by) chains. The "M" indicator seems to mean the part supersedes many
different parts and does not correspond to the "M" indicator used in Parts
Posting & Maintenance, which means the part is superseded by multiple
parts (kit).


[+] X3-1 PARTS INQUIRY Co

Point of Sale Detail Screen

Point of Sale uses both local inventory and the price book to sell the first
available part in a forward chain, and always displays the last part number
in the chain. A part that has been superseded by multiple parts shows
simply *MULTIPLE*.

Part In Inventory

Availability information is displayed. If the request cannot be filled by the
first part entered, the next part in the chain with available quantity will be
displayed on the comment line. After all available parts have been sold,
the last part in the chain can be ordered.

Part Not in Inventory (
Regardless of where you start in a chain, the last part in the chain is

displayed on the comment line. If it is not possible to order the part you

enter, such as AA1117, you will receive an “Invalid part" message, and the

Most current part will be displayed on the comment line. If it is possible to

order the part you entered, it will be displayed on the detail line with a "P"

priority code, but the most current part number will be displayed on the

comment line.

X3-1 PARTS INQUIRY [=]

Part Availability

Part in Inventory
All superseding parts in the chain that are in inventory are displayed
whether they will be needed to meet the request or not.

Part Not In inventory

Part Availability searches local inventory, other divisions, and the price
book. All parts in the forward supersession chain will be displayed. If the
original part requested is in the requesting division's inventory but not
available, it will show "NOT OK." Parts located in the price book will be
indented and show "NOT OK/PRC BOOK." If you left-justify the parts
and press [Enter] again, the system will search other divisions for the
superseding part and display availability information. You will be able to
order the last part in the chain, if necessary. The system will repeat the
quantity, which is adjusted manually as you decide what parts to sell.

Electronic Parts Catalog

As of 11/5/96, the DIS interface to the parts catalog displays ] level of
backward supersession and the Jast part(s) in the forward chain (1 level). If
the parts listed are in the dealer's inventory, availability and bin location
are displayed. No intermediate parts are shown, regardless of whether the
part is in the dealer's local inventory or not. Multiple "Superseded by" part
numbers indicate a kit. Multiple "Supersedes" may be from a kit to one
part or simply separate parts that have been superseded by the same part.

Multiple supersession is the most difficult because manufacturers do not

make it clear whether a part is superseded by 3 different single parts or by
a kit consisting of 3 parts. In some cases, the original part number is


[«] X3-1 PARTS INQUIRY oO

superseded by several different part numbers, any one of which can be
used to replace the original part. In other cases, the original part is
superseded by a kit composed of several different part numbers, all of
which are required to do the job of the 1 original part number. In either
case, the DIS Business System displays "*MULTIPLE*” in the "Super."
field at Point of Sale. If possible, use the comment field on the Parts
Posting & Maintenance screen to store all part numbers that are required
for supersession.

Stand-alone parts catalogs (without the DIS interface) display only the last
part(s) in a forward supersession chain.

### Remanufactured Parts

New parts reference the remanufactured (reman) part. Reman parts show
prices of the reman part and its primary core and reference the primary
core part number. Primary cores reference alternate cores, if any. For more
information on reman parts, see chapter X38-1, CONFIGURE
VENDOR/CLASS.

Evoke the Parts Window by putting a "?" in the "Part Number" field from
any screen. You may perform a search by part number by entering a text
string after the "?". Except that the text string begins with a "?" the
resulting search would be equivalent to a search by part number detailed

positioned in the Parts Index to the first part that begins with text string

Alternately, if you precede the text string with a "*" the computer will
display ail parts that contain the text string you entered in any position.
For example "*10" would find 10551, 911002, and, 6510. This is called a
non-positional search.

You may also perform a search by description. This works in the same

way as the parts search, except that [Cmd5] and not [Enter] is pressed after

### Sales History Screen

The information on the Sales History Screen is updated by transactions at
Point of Sale and by transactions from the Transaction Screen at Parts
Posting & Maintenance. Sales History is automatically updated when Parts
End of Day is run. It can be updated manually when you are adding parts
to your DIS inventory for which you already have some history. See
Chapter X3-2, PARTS POSTING AND MAINTENANCE.

Sales History is kept by the system for 3 years. When Parts End of Year is
run, the system gets rid of all history over 24 months and leaves room for
the new year. This is something to remember when you request a
phase-out or sales return based on history.

Sales: A sale of 5 widgets to one person is recorded as 1 call, 5 pieces.
Lost Sales: A lost sale where one person wanted 5 widgets is recorded as
1 call and 5 pieces. The only difference in the way lost sales are recorded
is where they are summarized on the Parts Management Report (X36-2)
where there is a special category, "Lost sales”.

## CHAPTER X3-2

PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE

### Introduction

Parts Posting & Maintenance could be used without Point of Sale as a
complete inventory control system. It replaces the parts card file which is
used in a manual system. New parts can be added, information can be
updated, and sales history records can be kept. Transactions recorded in
Parts Posting & Maintenance are summarized on the Parts Management
Report (X36-2).

When the Point of Sale application has been installed, most inventory
control functions are handled automatically, so that Parts Posting &
Maintenance is used most often to correct segmentation errors, to change
information on existing part records, and to make minor quantity
adjustments to inventory.

These are the options within Parts Posting & Maintenance. Only the
command keys listed on the screen are available:

Cmd1 -End job
Cmd2 -Information Screen

Cmd3 -Sales History Screen

Cmmd4 -Transaction Screen

Cmd5 -Source of Supply Screen
Cmd11-XRef (Cross-reference) Screen
Cmd13-Notebook

In this chapter there is a section for each screen, where examples and field
limits are provided. The last section, WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND
WHAT TO DO, covers the most frequent problems with parts files.

Note: if your dealership has part numbers that begin with the "#"
character, it would be a good idea to change them. Bearing Interchange is
disabled on the Transaction Screen. Use this screen to change part
numbers that begin with "#."

The concept of cores is very simple, yet it can be extended to many
situations and provides a new dimension in inventory management. First,

Note the field on the right side of the screen labeled "Core code" (under
“Qty.Break"). This 1-character field is user-defined and accommodates
any alpha-numeric character. When you sell a part with a core code at
Point of Sale, the system "looks at” the first 18 characters of the comment
line. If it finds a valid part number there, the system places both parts on
the sales document--the part with the core code plus the part number in the
first 18 characters of the comment line.

The only restriction is that both part numbers must have the same vendor
code. This feature is available on the detail screen at Point of Sale and on
the Part Availability screen (Cmd12). Both setup and sales will be
illustrated in this chapter.

To keep up with parts that have core codes, a new option has been added
to the Parts Report Menu (X3-6): Core Inventory Pad. On this report only
parts with core codes are listed, and you can choose to exclude up to 6
codes. In contrast, the Parts Inventory Pad option (X36-1) lists all parts;
however, it also allows you to exclude up to 6 core codes.

To keep track of who has paid core charges and who has received refunds,
you can use a new option, Part Sales History, which is option 7 on the
Point of Sale Invoicing Menu. The same option is available on the
Additional Options Menu (Cmd11 from Point of Sale). For more
information, see CHAPTER X5-7, PART SALES HISTORY.

New parts reference the remanufactured (reman) part. Reman parts show
prices of the reman part and its primary core and reference the primary
core part number. Primary cores reference alternate cores, if any. For more
information on reman parts, see chapter X38-1, CONFIGURE
VENDOR/CLASS.

Core Code Setup

Although you probably won't use very many core codes, you should keep
a list of them and what they mean to you. Many dealers use the Letter
Writer option on the Marketing Menu (X4-5) to store information
pertaining to user-defined codes. In a basic setup, you may simply think of
the part and its core charge as parent and child, assigning a "P" and "C”
Tespectively. The part number that represents the core charge should be the
same as the parent number with a "C" at the end, as illustrated below.

Note:

Enter the part number in the first 18 characters of the comment line,
left justified. The remainder of the line is available for comments. It's (
safe to begin your comments directly under the "Quick code."

The next step is to add the part number that represents the Core Charge.
The vendor code must be the same; however, you might want to establish
a class especially for core charges to simplify report requests.

On the following screen, the part number that has been added for the core
charge of $35.00 is given an "On hand” quantity of 9,000. The actual
number doesn't matter as much as making it easy to remember what you
Started with. DIS suggests that you begin with the same quantity for all
core charges. If you know the standard quantity, you'll be more apt to doa
quick mental check each time you deal with core charges. If you notice a
substantial difference, you need to find out what's going on (see

Point of Sale

On the Point of Sale detail screen, all the salesperson needs to do is enter
the sales code and part number for the battery. When s/he presses [Enter],
the system adds the core charge to the document automatically.

When the core is returned, the salesperson will simply sell the core charge
part number with a quantity of -1.

Reports

Parts Inventory Pad (X36-1). The selection screen allows you to exclude
up to 6 core codes; however, a Parts Inventory Pad prints all parts for the
Vendor/Class selected.

Core Inventory Pad (X36-20). The selection screen is the same as the Parts
Inventory Pad above; however, the Core Inventory Pad prints only parts
that have core codes. You can exclude up to 6 core codes.

Advanced Techniques

Now that you have learned how to use core codes for standard core
charges, let's consider other ways to use the same feature. You can build
up "kits" of parts: Part 1 points to Part 2 which points to Part 3, etc. Every
time the system encounters a part with a core code, it will sell the part
number(s) on the comment line, making it possible to link up to 40 parts
together for a "kit". The maximum number of 40 is set to prevent a core
part being looped back to itself if the chain were endless.

For example, you might have a frame that is always sold with a set of
brackets and screws. By using a core code on the frame and the brackets’
part number in the comment field, you can have the brackets placed on the
same document. Because the bracket part number also has a core code and

PARTS INVENTORY


X3-2, PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE

 

the part number for the screws in its comment line, the screws are
automatically added as well.

Vendor PartNumber Description Core Code Comment Line
1 VVV_ A40660 FRAME P A52687

2 VVV AS52687 BRACKET Cc A100789

3 > VVV_ A100789 SCREWS Cc

To sell all 3 parts, the salesperson simply enters the first part number. The
system adds the other 2 parts automatically.

If the frame is returned, the system assumes that the bracket and screws
are also returned. If the bracket is returned, the system assumes the screws

are returned.

To sell or return any of the items separately, simply delete the lines you (
don't want.

For other ways to add lines to documents automatically, see Copy Lines at
Point of Sale.

X3-2_ PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE [n]

Cross-referencing

The cross-referencing feature for parts provides:

= Up to 26 different references to each part

= References incorporate vendor code and quantity

= Cross-reference numbers can be used in
. Parts Inquiry (X3-1)
. Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)
. Correct Order Before Receiving (X342-1)
. Point of Sale (X5-1) and Part Availability (Cmd12)

See: CROSS-REFERENCING SCREEN.

Disk Space

As with any extra feature, particularly one that pertains to many records,
you need to be aware of disk space. Cross-referencing 40 parts requires 1
block. Cross-referencing 10,000 parts takes 250 blocks of disk space.

To estimate how many blocks you need to use X32XRF, divide the
number of part numbers in your inventory by 40.

Each part can be cross-referenced to as many as 26 other part numbers,
which incorporate vendor code and quantity. For example, vendor AMI,
part C90921, quantity 4, can be cross-referenced to "C94" while quantity 6
is cross-referenced to "C96."

The indexes operate like quick codes except they can be longer--up to 24

characters. They can be used to assign bar code numbers if they are
different from the manufacturer's part number or part numbers from other
sources of supply. There is plenty of room to enter bolt or belt sizes so
they can be cross-referenced directly to part numbers. Also, filters and
other frequently sold parts can be located by the model number of the unit
they fit on. Then at Point of Sale, this detail line can be typed as follows:

PARTS COUNTER
TDI/W Pty Line SC Ven Qty Part number Price Base

Pressing [Enter] on the line illustrated above results in the following
entries:

PARTS COUNTER
TDIW Pty Line SC Yen Qty Part number

Standard line code No demand = Warranty

 


X3-2 PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE [=]

Price Books

Parts information may be kept in two places: in the parts files associated
with your User ID, which are known as your inventory files, and in a large
file known as a price book. A price book is separate from your inventory
and contains all of the parts the manufacturer supplies on a price tape.

If you have room on your disk for one or more price books, they can be a
big help at Parts Posting & Maintenance. Information from a price book
can be added directly to your parts inventory files, which saves a lot of
typing and ensures accuracy. Chapter X37-4, Create/Update Price Book
has the information you need to estimate the amount of disk space
required for a particular price book.

Quantity Break Pricing

What is Quantity Break Pricing? Many manufacturers receive quantity
break pricing from their suppliers, price breaks for buying in volume. The
price depends upon the quantity. For example, there may be one price if
they buy from I to 9 of an item, and a lower price if they buy 10 or more,
and an even lower price if they buy 50 or more. There may be several
ranges with corresponding price decreases. Manufacturers may choose to
pass these savings on to the dealers. Dealers, in turn, may want to pass the
savings on to customers who buy in large quantities.

Advantages of Quantity Break Pricing: Selling parts in large volumes
heips to reduce your costs. The parts do not have to be counted or handled
as often. Storage costs are decreased. Up front, the parts may not cost as
much because of the large quantity discounts received from the
manufacturer.

PARTS INVENTORY

## X3-2. PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE

 

What is required: A price book with quantity break pricing is required.
Quantity break pricing is furnished by some manufacturers, usually on a
separate price tape.

Identifying the Customers: With the DIS Special Feature, Quantity Break
Pricing, you can identify the customers who buy in volume (Receivables

Maintenance, X1 1-2). This information will be relayed to Point of Sale, so
that the customer may receive quantity break pricing on appropriate parts.

Identifying the Parts: The price tape sent by the manufacturer will
identify parts with quantity break prices and the breaks offered on specific
quantities (ranges).

Quantity break pricing information is kept in the price book, not in your

inventory files. If the price book is removed, quantity break information (
will be lost.

### Supersession

Supersession information is available in the following options:
- Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

- Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

- Display/Print Price Book (X37-3)

- Point of Sale Detail Line (X5-1)

- Part Availability (Cmd12 from X5-1)

- Electronic Parts Catalogs

Except for Display/Print Price Book (X37-3) and Electronic Parts
Catalogs, backward supersession is not handled. The DIS system attempts
to sell all parts from inventory in a forward chain and displays the last part
in the chain so it can be ordered, if necessary. The Electronic Parts Catalog
skips intermediate parts and displays only 1} level of backward and 1 level
of forward supersession (the last part in the chain).

Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

 

The Supersede code "S" means the part has been superseded by a single
part. "M" means the part has been superseded by multiple parts, only the
first (alphabetically) is displayed. This information is updated by price
tape update.

Parts In Inventory

If the entire chain is in inventory, it is displayed at F7=Supersession when
the original part number is entered. If a superseding part is entered, the
chain is displayed from that part forward. You must press F5=Division to
check availability for a part in other divisions.

PARTS INVENTORY


[| X3-2 PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE

Parts Not In Inventory

If the original part number is entered, the chain is revealed from the price
book one number at a time in a message at the bottom of the screen. If a
superseding part is entered, the chain is displayed from that part forward.

Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

Parts In Inventory

Supersession information can be added to any part manually. This is
overwritten when inventory is updated from a price tape or price book
unless the part is in a class flagged as non-updatable (automatic pricing =
N) in Configure Vendor/Class (X38-1). In the absence of a price book, this
information is used by POS to chain to superseding parts.

Parts Not fn Inventory

Parts may be added from the price book from any point in a chain. No
supersession information is retrieved, only pricing and the return code.
There is no way to know how many superseding parts there are or to go
directly to the end of the chain.

Display/Print Price Book (X37-3)

The price book displays backward (supersedes) and forward (superseded
by) chains. The "M" indicator seems to mean the part supersedes many
different parts and does not correspond to the "M" indicator used in Parts
Posting & Maintenance, which means the part is superseded by multiple
parts (kit).


Point of Sale Detail Screen

Point of Sale uses both local inventory and the price book to sell the first
available part in a forward chain, and always displays the last part number
in the chain. A part that has been superseded by multiple parts shows
simply *MULTIPLE*.

Part In Inventory

Availability information is displayed. If the request cannot be filled by the
first part entered, the next part in the chain with available quantity will be
displayed on the comment line. After all available parts have been sold,
the last part in the chain can be ordered.

Part Not In Inventory

Regardless of where you start in a chain, the last part in the chain is
displayed on the comment line. If it is not possible to order the part you
enter, such as AA1117, you will receive an “Invalid part" message, and the
most current part will be displayed on the comment line. If it is possible to
order the part you entered, it will be displayed on the detail line with a "P"
priority code, but the most current part number will be displayed on the
comment line.

PARTS INVENTORY


[=| X3-2 PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE 7

Part Availability

Part in Inventory
All superseding parts in the chain that are in inventory are displayed
whether they will be needed to meet the request or not.

Part Not In Inventory

Part Availability searches local inventory, other divisions, and the price

book. Al! parts in the forward supersession chain will be displayed. If the

original part requested is in the requesting division's inventory but not

available, it will show "NOT OK.” Parts located in the price book will be

indented and show "NOT OK/PRC BOOK.” If you left-justify the parts

and press [Enter] again, the system wiil search other divisions for the

superseding part and display availability information. You will be able to (
order the last part in the chain, if necessary. The system will repeat the

quantity, which is adjusted manually as you decide what parts to sell.

Electronic Parts Catalog

As of 11/5/96, the DIS interface to the parts catalog displays 1 level of
backward supersession and the last part(s) in the forward chain (1 level). If
the parts listed are in the dealer's inventory, availability and bin location
are displayed. No intermediate parts are shown, regardless of whether the
part is in the dealer's local inventory or not. Multiple “Superseded by" part
numbers indicate a kit. Multiple "Supersedes" may be from a kit to one
part or simply separate parts that have been superseded by the same part.

Multiple supersession is the most difficult because manufacturers do not

make it clear whether a part is superseded by 3 different single parts or by
a kit consisting of 3 parts. In some cases, the original part number is

RELEASE 2.1 to


X3-2_ PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE

 

superseded by several different part numbers, any one of which can be
used to replace the original part. In other cases, the original part is
superseded by a kit composed of several different part numbers, all of
which are required to do the job of the 1 original part number. In either
case, the DIS Business System displays "*MULTIPLE*" in the "Super."
field at Point of Sale. If possible, use the comment field on the Parts
Posting & Maintenance screen to store all part numbers that are required
for supersession.

 

Stand-alone parts catalogs (without the DIS interface) display only the last
part(s) in a forward supersession chain.

### Transaction Screen

The Transaction Screen can be used as a complete inventory control
system; however, Point of Sale takes care of most of the transactions so
that the Transaction Screen is most frequently used to add new parts,
correct segmentation errors, and make minor quantity adjustments to
inventory.

Note: The Transaction Screen is the only screen that allows you to access
parts that begin with the "@" character without starting bearing
interchange. See the Bearing Interchange section earlier in this chapter for
more information.

Full Screen (

The Transaction Screen is the first screen within the Parts Posting &
Maintenance job. The default vendor code from Security Maintenance
(X6-6), if any, will be in the Vendor field. It looks like this:

Recording a Transaction Using Full Screen

There are two ways to use the Transaction Screen. While you are learning,
you may want to fill in the part number or quick code before you choose a
transaction code. This will not work, of course, if you are adding a new

part, in which case you will get an error message that the part is not found.

Honda dealers may use the first 6 characters of the quick code with an
asterisk (*) as the 7th character.

(*) Delete Record

Delete record is used when you want to delete a part number and all of its
information from your inventory. It may be used when invalid parts have
been added in error or to get rid of obsolete parts. Deleted records are
subtracted in the "INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS - Part Adjustments”
section of the Parts Management Report (X36-2).

In Parts Posting & Maintenance a part cannot be deleted if there is an on
hand quantity or if there are reservations. To force the on hand quantity to
zero, use Minus to Inventory (Transaction Code = M).

When parts are phased out using Post Stock Phase-Out (X35-10), the parts

are deleted from inventory automatically even if there is an on hand
quantity.

(A) Add Record

Add Record is used to add a new part record to your inventory. It is not
used to add to the on hand quantity of parts already in your inventory (see
Plus, Receipt, or Transfer). These records are added to the "INVENTORY
ADJUSTMENTS - Part Adjustments" section of the Parts Management
Report (X36-2).

Adding Parts from PP&M

These steps are required to add a part in Parts Posting & Maintenance:

 

Add Record on the Transaction Screen.
Enter information on the Information Screen.

 

 

 

 

 

These steps are optional:

O Record On hand quantities on the Transaction Screen.

O Record Sales History on the Sales History Screen.

O Set up Source of Supply vendors on the Source of Supply Screen.

The main advantage in Parts Posting & Maintenance is that you can use a
price book to bring in current, accurate information about the parts.

Adding Parts From Initial Parts Data Entry

If you do not have a price book and if you have several parts to add, it is
probably faster to add parts from Initial Parts Data Entry (Menu X68-5).

In Initial Parts Data Entry only one screen is required to add the part to
inventory, record information, on hand quantity, and sales history.

PARTS INVENTORY


X3-2. PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE a

 

For your convenience, there are other places within the DIS System where
you can choose to add parts to inventory, including Correct Stock Order
(X341-2), Correct Order Before Receiving (X342-1), Point of Sale (X5-1),
and Priority Orders (X5-3).

Segment Markers

To Add a new part record or Change an existing record, segment markers
must be correctly placed in the part number. If the number is not too
complicated, you might be able to look at a similar part number which is
already in inventory and figure it out.

Otherwise, you must check the vendor configuration. You may use a Con-
figuration Report (X38-2) or look at the vendor in Configure Vendor/Class (
(38-1). What you are looking for are the segment sizes.

There can be up to 18 characters in a part number. These 18 characters can
be in 1 to 4 segments. To add or change a part number, segment markers
must be placed between the segments. This is how the computer knows
how to display or print the part numbers so that they look like the part
numbers you see in the manufacturer's book.

The total of the segment sizes may go as high as 22 even though the part
number cannot be over 18 characters.

Examples of configurations using the maximum segment sizes are:

06 06 06 04
02 10 10
04 18

08 08 06


PARTS INVENTORY

X3-2 PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE [=]

In each case the total of the segment sizes is 22.

The 08 08 06 configuration can be illustrated like this:

Valid part numbers: 12345678<12345678<12< (total characters = 18)
1234<12345678<123456< (total characters = 18)

12345678<<123456< (total characters = 14)


X3-2 PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE Cc

Invalid part numbers:
12345678<12345678<123456< (too long)

1234567890<1234< (first segment is too long)
123 5678<12345678<12< (contains blank)
1234<1234<1234<1234< (too many segments)

The configuration which will be used in the next example has 4 segments.
The segment sizes are: 04 03 07 06. This can be illustrated as:

The total of the segments (4 + 3 +7 + 6) is 20. Remember, however, that
no individual part number can be over 18 characters.

Look at some of the different ways in which variations of part number
MH328AE000341Y891 could be segmented with this configuration.

Missing segment 1: <328<AE000341<Y¥891<
Missing segment 2: MH<<AE000341<Y¥891<
Missing segments | & 2: <<AE000341<¥891<
Missing segment 3: MH<328<<Y891<
Missing segment 4: MH<328<AE000341<


PARTS INVENTORY


 

Missing segments 3 & 4: MH<328<
Missing segments 1, 2, & 4: <<AE000341<

There are too many different kinds of part numbers and combinations to
present all of them. Use these examples as guides.

The important things to remember are that no segment can have more
characters than configured, and you must leave a marker even if a segment
is missing. One segment marker at the end is sufficient.

If you see a message like this when you are trying to add a part, it is time
to check your segmentation carefully:

“New part# error: contains blanks, too long, or contains too many
segments.”

After entering the part information, return to the Transaction Screen to
record the On hand quantity by using a transaction code of R, Receipt to
inventory.


 

(C) Change Vendor/Part#

Change vendor/part# is used when you want to transfer all of the
information about a part number to a different number (supersession). It is
frequently used to correct segmentation errors. The old part number is
deleted, and the new part number is added. These changes are recorded in
the "INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS - Part Adjustments" section of the
Parts Management Report (X36-2). If the vendor is the same, the net effect
is zero.

Orders and Reservations: Parts which are on orders or reserved on open
documents can be re-segmented (changed to the same number with
different segmentation). They cannot be changed to a different number.

Quick code: To change a number which has a quick code, first go to the

Information Screen and remove the quick code. Return to the Transaction
Screen to change the part number.

(L) Post Lost Sale

Post Lost Sale is used to record a sale which was lost because the part was
not in stock. It increases the number of calls and pieces in sales history just
as if the part had been sold. The demand is increased so the part can be
considered for a Suggested Stock Order. The Lost Sales Report (X36-11)
can help you decide when it is time to reevaluate stocking procedures. In
addition, the dollar value of lost sales are tracked on the Parts
Management Report (X36-2, page 2, LOST SALES).

If you are using Point of Sale, record lost sales at invoicing by entering an
"L" in the priority code field on the parts detail line. The part will not
appear on the invoice. See Point of Sale Reference Section.

This example illustrates how to record a lost sale on 4 widgets. One
customer wanied 4 widgets, which were out of stock. She went to a com-
petitor who always stocks widgets. The sale was lost. Calls will be
increased by 1. Pieces will be increased by 4. Since sales history is
updated when Parts End of Day is run, this change will not show
immediately on the Sales History Screen.

(M) Minus to Inventory

Minus to Inventory is used to adjust your inventory because an error has
been made, and there are fewer parts actually on hand than the computer
shows. No change is made to sales history. Minus adjustments are
subtracted from the "INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS - Part Adjustments"
Section on the Parts Management Report (X36-2). The parts manager
should be aware of minus adjustments and find out what is going on if
there seem to be too many of them.

Minus to Inventory is designed for an occasional correction. Use the Parts
Inventory Adjustment Menu (X3-3) for scheduled physical inventories.

In this example inventory will be adjusted because there are only 2 of part {
78H9002RV9 on hand. The computer shows 3. Inventory must be adjusted

by Minus 1. The Transaction Code is M. A quantity must be used with this

Code. Type the quantity and Field Exit or Field + . Do not use Field - :

because that would add a part to inventory (minus a minus is a plus). Fill

in the Vendor and Part number. The screen looks like this:

Receipt to Inventory, or Receipt of Transfer), No change is made in sales
history. Plus adjustments are added to the "INVENTORY

Whatever is on this screen is in the actual part record. If anything is
different from the class configuration in Configure Vendor/Class, the part
record is what rules. For example, the order code can be different from the
class order code. The relationship of the prices can be different from the
class (dealer list may be 100% of suggested list in the part record but
110% of suggested list in the class), The relationship in the part record
will be maintained even when a price tape update is run.

Class code: Changing the class code affects the "INVENTORY
ADJUSTMENTS - Parts Adjustments" section of the Parts Management
Report (X36-2). It is recorded as a deleted part in the old class and as an
added part in the new class. The class code cannot be changed if the part is

Your prices are based on one or more of the prices on the tape. Ifa
manufacturer furnishes only 2 prices, Dealer Net or Cost, your prices must
be based on Price 1 and Price 3.

Bases are set up in Configure Vendor/Class, and that information is
brought to a new part record from the default class. If the class is changed
at Parts Posting & Maintenance, change the bases to match the new class.

How to enter prices: If the part comes from a price book, all of the prices
will be filled in automatically. The system looks at the price book and then
at the configuration in the default class. If you want to change the prices,
field exit through all of the price fields and enter new prices. The system
can calculate prices which are based on another price, such as the internal

What About Oil, Chain, and Screws?

Note:

The techniques described in this section were developed before the
addition of Core Codes, which could also be used effectively in these
Situations. See Cores.

 

Here are some hints about dealing with things like oil, chain, and boxes of
screws which each have a part number from the manufacturer, but which
you sell in smaller quantities. In this example we will consider a 55 gallon
drum of oil which you then sell in quarts, gallons, and 5 gallon containers.
The same principle applies to chain which is bought in 200 foot lengths
and sold by the foot, or screws which come in boxes of 100 but are sold
individually.

First set up the manufacturer's part number, which we will say is OIL999,
This is the parent number. You might want to set up a special class for
parent numbers, such as P = Parent, so that it will be easy to run a parts
pad or suggested order for these parts.

Look at the Memo line. That tells you (and the people at Point of Sale)
that other part numbers have been set up, and the comment will be on a
suggested stock order if requested. We will Add records for part numbers
OILQ, OILG, and OILS. These may be called the children of OIL999. Use
the parent number's vendor code. You might want to keep these parts in a
special class, such as C = Children so that it will be easy to run a parts
pads and suggested stock orders, but especially so that these parts can be
repriced using Reprice Parts (X37-1).

There are 55 x 4 = 220 quarts of oil in a drum. With this part number,

OILQ, you are now set up to sell oil by the quart. The cost is $77.00

N

divided by 220 = 35 cents. Post the sale of one drum (OIL999) and the

receipt of 220 quarts (OILQ). Follow this pattern for gallons. Sell one

drum (OIL999), and receive 55 gallons (OILG). Then set up OILS. Sell

one drum (OJL999), and receive 11 5-gallon "parts" (OILS).

Ordering: A Combined order method is selected, so that the minimum
will be considered. As the children of OIL999 are sold, they will appear on
Suggested orders to let you know that it is time to transfer again. When the

parent, OIL999, goes below the minimum of 3, it will appear


X3-2 PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE Co

on a suggested order. It may be helpful to keep all Parent parts in a special
class, such as P = Parent, so that you can review them easily.

Pricing: The children numbers should be set up under the same vendor
code as the parent number. Since the 3 children part numbers, Ola,
OILG, and OILS are not on the price tape, they cannot be updated. They
will appear on the report of parts which could not be updated. That is your
signal to reprice them according to the parent number: OIL999. If they are
kept in a special class, such as C = Children, it will be easy to reprice them
with Reprice Parts (X37-1).

AGCO Promo codes

If you are an AGCO dealer and the part you have selected is part of an {
AGCO promotion, you will see its AGCO code on the right side of the

unlabeled comment line towards the top of the screen. This is the same

line where core codes are entered.

### Sales History Screen

The information on the Sales History Screen is updated by transactions at
Point of Sale and by transactions from the Transaction Screen at Parts
Posting & Maintenance. Sales History is automatically updated when Parts
End of Day is run. Usually it is updated manually only when you are
adding parts to your DIS inventory for which you already have some
history.

Sales History is kept by the system for 3 years. When Parts End of Year is
Tun, the system gets rid of all history over 24 months and leaves room for
the new year. This is something to remember when you request a phase-
out or sales return based on history.

RELEASE 2.1 LU


Sales: A sale of 5 widgets to one person is recorded as 1 call, 5 pieces.

Lost Sales: A lost sale where one person wanted 5 widgets is recorded as

1 call‘and 5 pieces. The only difference in the way lost sales are recorded

is where they are summarized on the Parts Management Report (X36-2)

where there is a special section, "LOST SALES". .

SOURCE OF SUPPLY SCREEN

Use this screen if you can save money or time by buying the part from a
source other than the manufacturer. Source of Supply information is
optional, and it is maintained manually. Alternate vendors may be set up
as valid vendor codes in Configure Vendor Class (X38-1); however, prices
on the Source of Supply screen are not updated by price tapes.

You can request system-generated stock orders for parts from one or all of
the alternate sources (see CHAPTER X341-1, CREATE SUGGESTED
STOCK ORDER). You can also specify that the order include only parts
where one of these sources is the primary source. For example, you can
create an order for all parts supplied by Sue or only the parts for which
SUE is the primary source.

The final printed order can be separated by vendor, if desired. A standard
order for the manufacturer's part numbers appears on the left, and the

RELEASE 2.1 oa


corresponding part numbers from the alternate source is listed on the right.
See CHAPTER X341-3, PRINT/FINALIZE ORDER.

Because the parts are linked to the manufacturer's part numbers, the order
is received as if the manufacturer's order had been placed.

Automatic Cross-referencing

One very practical application of this feature is to cross-reference all your
part numbers to themselves and eliminate the need for a vendor code at
Point of Sale. DIS has provided a utility, X32XRF, to do this
automatically using a quantity of 1.

If the utility encounters duplicate part numbers, the first vendor/part

number is cross-referenced, and the others are listed on a report so you can
decide how to cross-reference them later.

### What Can Go Wrong And What To Do

For many problems in parts files the solution is to run Parts End of Month.
It is the DIS equivalent of take 2 aspirin and call me in the morning.

Parts files are extremely large. Every part in your inventory has informa-
tion in more than one file. "Pointers" in one file point to the corresponding
part information in other files. Because of the sheer size and complexity of
these files, plus the wear and tear of daily use, it is not uncommon for the
pointers to get mixed up and point to the wrong places. The results may be
quite strange, but there is no need for alarm.

Parts End of Month reorganizes the parts files and straightens out the

pointers. It is OK to run Parts End of Month more than once a month, and (
it is equally important to run it at least once a month.

Availability Formula Is Not Correct

What if the Available does not equal the On Hand - Reservations? This is
an example of a widget as seen at Parts Inquiry.

Available... 0
Reserve R/O: 0
Reserve C/T: 3
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 0

The formula is not correct. Available (0) is not equal to On Hand (0)
minus Reservations (3).

RELEASE 2.1 LL


X3-2_ PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE |

In this case there is something else wrong. This widget cannot be cured by
adjustments. Most often what has happened is that reservations have been
canceled (are not in the Point of Sale u.SAM file), but this message never
reached the parts file.

WHAT TO DO

in V7LIB and higher there is a procedure which will correct this situation.
The only limitation is that you must be using sales codes of 2 characters
(PC, MC, etc.) for this procedure to be successful.

After Point of Sale and parts jobs have been finished for the day, get a list
of parts with reservations at Parts Inquiry but without corresponding
reservations at Point of Sale.

Look at the report carefully. If you are satisfied, run the procedure which
will make corrections.

### Introduction

The Inventory Adjustment Menu provides an easy way to conduct a
physical inventory with an audit trail. This feature promotes a perpetual
inventory system which eliminates the costly, often inaccurate, and always
inconvenient annual inventory event.

### Overview

The Inventory Adjustment Menu contains the following jobs:

X33-1 Parts Inventory Adjustment
Allows adjustments to On Hand or Available Quantities
and Bin Locations of parts on the Parts Inventory
Adjustment Report. Establishes the Last Count date from
session date in effect.

X33-2 Parts Inventory Adjustment Report
Prints a report of parts to be inventoried. The report may be
in order by bin location or by part number. Available or On
Hand quantities may be printed on this report if desired.

X33-3 Parts Exception Report
Lists parts which were on the Inventory Adjustment Report
but which were skipped during the Inventory Adjustment
job.

X33-4 Parts Inventory Freeze
Use Parts Inventory Freeze to take a snapshot of your parts
inventory files prior to a major change, such as Inventory
Adjustment or a Price Tape Update.

### The Inventory Process

This section explains the steps involved in taking inventory.
Get a List of the Parts to be Inventoried.

Run the Parts Inventory Adjustment Report (X33-2). A portion of the
inventory is selected. This may be in order by bin location or part number.
The idea is to select a manageable number of bins or parts, perhaps only
what can be handled in one day by one person.

Example:
Bins A1 through B22 or parts A12345 through A67890 for vendor ABC.

Note:

If your bins begin with numbers (1-12, 2H-30), and you want the

report by bin location, request the Compressed version. The procedure
for Expanded is looking for a letter first, and if there is none, the
results may be strange.

 

The report (list) will be printed as requested. More than one copy may be
requested if more than one person will be counting. It may be single or
double spaced. Available or on hand quantities may be printed or not, just
as you prefer.


 

Advantages of a Blind Count

When the Quantity is not printed on the Inventory Adjustment Report, it is
called a Blind Count.


here are 2 advantages:

a The actual count is more likely to be accurate, since no estimate
can be made based on the report.

If the status changes from the time the report is printed until the
actual count is made, the quantity counted and the "Available"
field on screen will be the same.

 

 

 

 

The Inventory Adjustment File (

Calling for the Inventory Adjustment Report creates a file, u.JJMd (u =
your User ID and d = your division code). There can be only one of these
files per division. If an u.IJMd file already exists you will be asked
whether you want it to be deleted.

The Inventory Adjustment Report will be a picture of the parts as they
were at the time the report was requested. The file, u.IJMd is updated by
activity at Point of Sale or PPM.

Two Ways to Count Inventory
Available Count
Available quantities display in PPM (X3-2) and Parts Inquiry (X3- 1).

Available quantities are the amount of the parts that are available for sale.
If you are counting available quantities, it is assumed that only parts that

RELEASE 2.1 LO


 

are available for sale are in the bin. A will call area exists where all parts
that are reserved have been placed. Also, it is assumed that all priority
ordered parts have been identified.

On Hand Count

On hand quantities are displayed in PPM (X3-2) and Parts Inquiry (X3-1).
If you are counting on hand quantities, the basic assumption is that all
parts are in the bin. No parts are located in other parts of the dealership.

Make the Adjustments

Run Parts Inventory Adjustment (X33-1). This is the job in which
adjustments are actually made.

There may be some parts which are on the report but which, for some
reason, are not counted. There may be questions concerning the actual
available or on hand quantity. These parts may be skipped. They will
appear on the Inventory Exception Report. For details, see the section,
When to Skip a Part.

What to Look For

Since the purpose of inventory adjustment is to reconcile what the
computer thinks you have with what you actually have, you are concerned
with parts where the Available or On hand counted does not match what's
in the Available or On hand field on screen.

Changing the Available or On Hand field on screen is the same as Plus or
Minus at Parts Posting & Maintenance. The change is listed in the same
place on the Parts End of Day Report. The only difference is that the
Application (App) is IVJ if it is done from Inventory Adjustment instead


 

of PPM for Parts Posting & Maintenance.

Also, Inventory Adjustment will update the Last Count Date displayed at
PPM or Parts Inquiry.

When To Make An Adjustment - Available Count

Example:

In Bin Al there are 4 widgets (Or available counted = 4). In the Inventory
Adjustment job the Available field on screen is 3 widgets. This widget is
not on a Priority Order. This calls for an adjustment.

Available on screen is changed to 4. On Hand will simultaneously be
increased by 1 widget. This is the same as Plus in Parts Posting &
Maintenance. The Parts End of Day Report will show an inventory
adjustment (App = IVJ). The next Parts Pad will reflect the change. The
audit trail is intact.

For details on when you should not make an adjustment, see the section,
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND WHAT TO DO.

When to Make An Adjustment - On Hand Count

Example:

In Bin B200, there are 6 widgets. In the Inventory Adjustment job, the
"Available" field on screen displays 5 widgets. No parts are located
anywhere in the dealership. This calls for an adjustment. On hand,
displayed in the On Hand field on screen, is changed to 6. Available will
simultaneously be increased by 1 widget. This is the same as Plus in Parts

RELEASE 2.1 LL


 

Posting & Maintenance. The Parts End of Day Report will show an
inventory adjustment (App = I'VJ). The next Parts Pad will reflect the
change. The audit trail is intact.

Por details on when you should not make an adjustment, see the section,
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND WHAT TO DO.

Reviewing a List of the Exceptions

Run the Parts Inventory Exception Report (X33-3). This report is run after
the adjustments have been made to most of the parts. The parts which were
skipped will be on this report. Questions about these parts should be
resolved. Then the Inventory Adjustment job should be run again to
include them in this count. The Inventory Adjustment job allows you to
skip around, so it doesn't take long to go back in.

For help in resolving questions, see the section WHAT CAN GO
WRONG AND WHAT TO DO.

Deleting the Inventory Adjustment File

To conserve disk space, the inventory adjustment file should be deleted
when you are through using it.

### What Are The Basic Assumptions?

To understand how to use the DIS Inventory System most efficiently, you
must understand its basic assumptions and act accordingly.

Timing is critical. The most important thing is to keep the time spans from
running the report to the counting to making the adjustments at a
minimum. Mark the bins which are being counted. Report any activity to
the person who is doing the counting. Since the DIS System is so easy to
do in small chunks, this usually is not difficult, and questions can be
resolved quickly.

Decide to adjust Available or On hand quantities. Remember the
assumptions: (

Available= If adjusting available quantities, only those parts available
for sale are still in the bins. All reserved parts have been
pulled from the bin and priority order parts identified.

OnHand= All parts are in the bin. Reservations have not been pulled.

You have identified any parts on reservation but not in the
bin.

### Adjusting Available Quantities

Assumption 1: Only Available Parts are Left in the Bins

The assumption is that only the parts that are actually available are in the
bins. This means that parts which are reserved (on open repair orders or

RELEASE 2.1 LL


counter tickets) have been taken out of the bins and put somewhere else.
The basic formula is: AVAILABLE = ON HAND - RESERVATIONS.

Here is an example of a widget as seen at Parts Inquiry before it is put on
an open repair order:

BEFORE Available..: 1
REPAIR Reserve R/O: 0
ORDER Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 1
PTY qty....: 0

As soon as the widget is placed on an open repair order, its status changes:

ON OPEN Available..: 0
REPAIR Reserve R/O: 1
ORDER Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 1
PTY qty....: 0

The formula is correct. Available (0) = On Hand (1) - Reservations (1).

If inventory is taken at this point, the system expects that the widget has
been taken out of the bin. The person who is counting will find zero
widgets available. If the Available Quantity is printed on the Inventory
Adjustment Report, it will be zero. The Available Quantity on screen in
the Inventory Adjustment job will also be zero.

If the Repair Order is closed in the meantime, the Available Quantity does


 

not change:
AFTER Available..: 0
REPAIR Reserve R/O: 0
ORDER Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 0

There is no problem.

What You Can Do

If you do not usually remove parts from the bins as soon as they are placed

on a repair order or a counter ticket, develop a system which will serve the t
same purpose. You could put a blue card in the bin with the number

reserved written on it. Or, the person who is counting could review the list

of reservations by part number for possible reservations. The person who

is counting will deduct reservations from the number actually counted.

If a system cannot be successfully developed, you may want to adjust On
Hand quantities instead of Available quantities.

Assumption 2: Parts On Priority Orders Have Been Identified.

Parts on Priority Orders will most often have a negative available
quantity. The best place to find all of the parts which are on Priority
Orders is the Print Order Lines Report (X34-7). Run this report before
Inventory Adjustment is started. Then you can resolve most of the
questions while you are doing the Inventory Adjustment job.

The other place to find out is in Parts Inquiry. Parts on finalized Priority

RELEASE 2.1 LL


 

Orders have an amount in the "PTY qty" field. If you do not have the Print
Order Lines Report handy or if the part has been placed on order since the
Inventory Adjustment began, check Parts Inquiry for the latest
developments.

Let's follow a widget which is out of stock.

BEFORE Available..: 0
COUNTER Reserve R/O: 0
TICKET Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 0

As soon as the widget is placed on an open counter ticket, its status
changes. The part is placed on a Priority Order. The Priority Order is

finalized.
ON OPEN Available..: -1
COUNTER Reserve R/O: i)
TICKET Reserve C/T: 1
On Hand....: 0
PTY gty....: 1

The formula is correct. Available (-1) = On Hand (0) - Reservations (1). If
inventory is taken at this point, what will happen?

a The Inventory Adjustment Report does not print negative
Available Quantities, just as people cannot count negative
amounts.

a The person who is counting will find no widgets.


 

 

 

 

 

The Available Quantity on screen in the Inventory Adjustment job

will be -1.

oO The number counted (0) does not match the Available Quantity on
screen.

Oo Look for the widget on the Print Order Lines Report.

If the Reservations for the part on the Print Order Lines Report matches
the Available Quantity on screen, accept the count and proceed. Another
way to check is to look at the Available Quantity on the Reservations
Report. Sometimes widgets must be priority ordered to fill an order even if
there are some on hand. You must check around whenever there is a
question.

Priority Order Has Been Received

If the widget has arrived and the Counter Ticket has been closed in the
meantime, the Available Quantity on screen will be zero.

AFTER Available..: 0
COUNTER Reserve R/O: 0
TICKET Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: QO
PTY qty....: 0

In this case, the Available Quantity on screen will match what the person
counted. All is well, There is no need to skip the part.

When to Skip a Part

If the part is not on the Print Order Lines Report or if the Available
Quantity on the report does not match what is on screen, check Parts

{
RELEASE 2.1 NY


 

Inquiry for the very latest developments. Adjust the Available Quantity
appropriately or skip the part until you determine what is appropriate.

If the part is skipped in the Inventory Adjustment job, it will appear on the
Parts Inventory Exception Report. The status of these parts should be
resolved before you go on to another portion of inventory.

What You Can Do

Alert the person who is counting if the part is placed on a Priority Order.
You could write the number ordered on a red card and put this into the bin.
This would let the person counting know to expect a difference in the
Available Counted and the Available on screen. Probably the best thing is
just to give a list of any parts placed on Priority Orders after the
adjustment process has begun.

What NOT To Do

Do not adjust the Available up to zero without first checking Priority
Orders carefully. See the section, WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND
WHAT TO DO.


 

ADJUSTING ON HAND QUANTITIES

Assumption 1: All Parts are Left in the Bins

The assumption is that no parts have been pulled from the bins. This
means that parts which are reserved (on open repair orders or counter
tickets) are still located in the bins and not placed somewhere else.

The basic formula is: AVAILABLE = ON HAND - RESERVATIONS.

Here is an example of a widget as seen at Parts Inquiry before it is put on
an open repair order:

BEFORE Available..: 1 (
REPAIR Reserve R/O: 0
ORDER Reserve C/T: 0

On Hand....: 1

PTY qty....: 0

As soon as the widget is placed on an open repair order, its status changes:

ON OPEN Available..: 0
REPAIR Reserve R/O: 1
ORDER Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 1
PTY qty....: 0

The formula is correct. Available (0) = On Hand (1) - Reservations (1).

RELEASE 2.1 CC


 

If inventory is taken at this point, the system expects that the widget is still
in the bin. The person who is counting will find one widget in the bin. If
the On hand Quantity is printed on the Inventory Adjustment Report, it
will be one. The On Hand field on screen in the Inventory Adjustment job
will also be one.

The Repair Order is Closed

If the Repair Order is closed in the meantime, the On hand Quantity does

change:
AFTER Available..: 0
REPAIR Reserve R/O: 0
ORDER Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 0
PTY aty....: 0

It is assumed that before closing the Repair Order, the part was removed
from the bin. The person who is counting will find no parts in the bin. The
report will show no parts On Hand. The counter will change the quantity
to 0 (zero). There is no problem.

Assumption 2: All parts not in the bin have been identified.

Assumption one states that all parts are in the bin, even reserved parts.
Realistically, this may not be the case. For example, you have a unit that is
in need of repair.

The parts have been placed on the POS Repair Order and given to the

mechanic. The Repair Order is not closed because the mechanic's time
must be added to the ticket when the job is completed.


 

Before the repair order is closed, it looks like this:

BEFORE CLOSING Available..: 0

REPAIR ORDER Reserve R/O: 1
Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 1
PTY qty....: 0

If the part is counted now, the on hand would be adjusted to zero (0)
because the counter sees no parts. This would not be the correct count.

When to Skip a Part

Print a Reservations Report. This will list all parts reserved for Counter
Tickets and Repair Orders.

If the part being counted displays on the Reservation Report and you
cannot account for the reserved part, do not change the On Hand quantity.

The part merits investigation. Account for any parts not in the bins.

What You Can Do

If you usually remove parts from the bins as soon as they are placed on a
repair order or a counter ticket, develop a system to account for these
parts. You could put a blue card in the bin with the number reserved
written on it. Or, the person who is counting could review the list of
reservations by part number for possible parts on open repair orders or
counter tickets. The person who is counting will deduct reservations from

RELEASE 2.1 LO


 

the number actually counted.

If a system cannot be successfully developed, you may want to adjust
Available quantities instead of On Hand quantities.


 

### What Can Go Wrong And What To Do

When the Available or On hand Quantity is changed on screen, inventory
value is changed accordingly. If the Available Quantity is increased,
inventory value increases because the On Hand Quantity has also
increased. This will be reflected on the Parts End of Day Report and on the
Parts Inventory Pad. This is exactly what you would expect.

The Parts Inventory Pad does not do anything about negative available. It
is concerned with On Hand Quantity. HOWEVER, changing a negative
available to zero is the same as adding to On Hand Quantity, which may or
may not be accurate so take care.

Negative Available Changed to Zero

To understand what happens if a negative available is changed to a zero,
let's follow one widget again.

Part on Priority Order

This widget is on a Priority Order. At Parts Inquiry it looks like this:

Available..: -1
Reserve R/O: 0
Reserve C/T: 1
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 1

On the Parts Inventory Pad this widget is listed as zero On Hand;
therefore, it is not included in the Net or List Prices in the Summary.

The person who is counting will find no widgets. On the Inventory

i
RELEASE 2.1 NY


Adjustment screen there will be an Available Quantity of -1, which is
correct, but the person does not bother to check the Print Order Lines
Report and changes the Available to zero. Now the widget Jooks like this:

Available..: 0
Reserve R/O: 0
Reserve C/T: 1
On Hand....: 1
PTY qty....: 1

Since the Parts Inventory Pad looks at On Hand, the totals will now
include this widget although no real change in inventory has occurred.


 

Pretty soon the widget arrives. When it is received, it looks like this at

Parts Inquiry.

Available..: 1

Reserve R/O: 0

Reserve C/T: 1

On Hand....: 2

PTY qty....: 0

Now the Counter Ticket is closed and the widget looks like this:
Available..: 1

Reserve R/O: 0

Reserve C/T: 0

On Hand....: 1

PTY qty....: 0 (
What to do

But there are still no widgets in the bin, Now the inventory must be
adjusted at Parts Posting & Maintenance to Minus the widget which had
been added incorrectly at Inventory Adjustment.

Part Had Been Robbed

Robbing parts drives both the On Hand and Available Quantities negative.
It also upsets the balance between the Parts Pad and the General Ledger
Inventory Account.

Let's follow one $2.00 widget as an example. Before robbing, the widget
looks like this at Parts Inquiry.

BEFORE Available... 0

RELEASE 2.1 LO


 

ROB Reserve R/O: 0
Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 0
ON OPEN Available... -1
COUNTER Reserve R/O: 0
TICKET Reserve C/T: 1
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 0
AFTER Available: -1
COUNTER Reserve R/O: 0
TICKET Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: -1
PTY qty....: 0

The formula is correct. Available (-1) = On Hand (-1) - Reservations (0).

When the part is sold, cost is transferred from the General Ledger
Inventory Account to Cost of Sale. The inventory account is decreased by
the cost of the part ($2.00), which may or may not have been included in
the total.

What if this part is included on the Inventory Adjustment Report before
this unfortunate situation is cleared up?


 

The person who is counting finds no widgets. The Available or On hand
Quantity on screen is -1. The part is not on a Priority Order. The Quantity
is changed to zero.

Now the widget looks like this at Parts Inquiry.

AFTER Available... 0

ADJUSTMENT Reserve R/O: 0
Reserve C/T: 0
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 0

This is correct.

The adjustment is listed on the Parts End of Day Report as an Inventory
Adjustment of +1 at +$2.00.

Now think about the Parts Inventory Pad. In this pure case the General
Ledger Inventory Account exactly matched the cost on the Parts Pad
before inventory. The negative available did not affect the total value
figures. Neither will the zero available or on hand. There are still zero On
Hand. The Parts Pad totals do not reflect the change, but the General
Ledger account does. The audit trail has been broken.

It is not so much that the adjustment process disrupted things. Rather the
habit of robbing parts is not a good one. Hopefully, once inventory is
correct, it can be kept that way with no more robbing.

RELEASE 2.1 LL


 

What to do - Journal Entries

If you are making journal entries following inventory adjustments, use the
figures from the Parts End of Day Reports instead of the difference in the
totals on the Parts Pad.

The Formula Is NOT Correct

What if the Available does not equal the On Hand - Reservations? This is
an example of a widget as seen at Parts Inquiry.

Available..: 0
Reserve R/O: 0
Reserve C/T: 3
On Hand....: 0
PTY qty....: 0

The formula is not correct. Available (0) is not equal to On Hand (0)
minus Reservations (3).

In this case there is something else wrong. This widget cannot be cured by
adjustments. Most often what has happened is that reservations have been
canceled (are not in the Point of Sale u.SAM file), but this message never

reached the parts file.

What to do

In V7L1B and higher there is a procedure which will correct this situation.
The only limitation is that you must be using sales codes of 2 characters
(PC, MC, etc.) for this procedure to be successful.

After Point of Sale and parts jobs have been finished for the day, get a list
of parts with reservations at Parts Inquiry but without corresponding
reservations at Point of Sale.

### Physical Inventory

The procedures outlined below are suggested for dealers who want to use a
larger crew to complete a full count in one day and a reduced crew to do
the recounts on the next day. Preparation should begin at least one week
before the actual count.

These procedures can be adapted for use in a perpetual inventory count as
recommended by DIS. For more information about the inventory process,
refer to CHAPTER X3-3, INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT MENU, in the
DIS User Manual. For instructions on how to run individual jobs, refer to
the appropriate chapters.

### Preparation

o Locate negative on hand quantities: On-Hand Quantity Report
(%36-5), Min = 10000-, Max = 1-.

Oo Locate parts that have available quantities but no bin locations:
Bin Location Range Report (X36-14), "All Blank Locations With
Available Quantity" = Y.

o Keep stock orders to a minimum.

Oo Review Ship Direct packing slips for partial shipments.

Discuss incoming shipments with warehouse personnel: Make sure

stock is put in correct bin locations, update incorrect locations.

o Discuss parts movement to and from the shop in order to hold it to
a minimum. Ask the shop to return parts that aren't needed for
work orders now instead of waiting until big jobs are finished. If
they anticipate needing parts, ask them to get them out of inventory


 

ASAP. Also, ask the shop to keep orders to a minimum before the
last day.
oO Review Retumed Goods Authorization (RGA) paperwork and
invoices. Tag RGA parts, if appropriate.
Review core credits.
Make arrangements for temporary help, if necessary. A data entry
person can be trained quickly to enter the final count sheets in
Parts Inventory Adjustment (X33-1), freeing your experienced
personnel to concentrate on the actual count.
Develop a schedule, assign jobs to staff.

PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU

### Introduction

The options on the Automatic Price Update Menu allow you to reprice the
parts in your inventory files when you want to deal with more than one
part at a time. You may update parts according to the most current prices
furnished by the manufacturer, and you may create a price book on your
hard disk.

Review of Pricing Options

To help you select the most efficient way to reprice parts, here is a review
of the options offered by the DIS Business System. Manual and automatic
pricing are available in the following jobs:

Job Type — Reprices Controlled by:
Screen Field
PPM (X3-2) Manual Individual None
Reprice Parts
Individual Manual Individual None
By Field Auto Class X38-1 Automatic pricing

By Direct ship Auto Class X37-1 Reprice & Percent
Price Tape Update Auto Class X38-1 Auto pricing & Update
Case Communications Auto Class X38-1 CASE Special Process

update.

In Vendor/Class Configuration (X38-1), automatic pricing is controlled by
Class Information. The following fields, which accept simply Yes or No,
govern automatic pricing:

 

 

 

Automatic pricing, which applies to automatic pricing by Reprice Parts
(By Field and By Value) and Price Tape Update. An "N” in this field
stops all automatic pricing except Reprice by Direct Ship and CASE
communications update.

 

CO) Update, which applies only to Price Tape Update of individual price
levels: Dealer List, Suggested List, Intemal, and Dealer Net. This field
has no effect on repricing from Reprice Parts (X37-1). If Automatic
pricing=Y and Suggested List Update = N, the Suggested List price
field can be changed by Reprice jobs, but it cannot be changed by Price
Tape Update (X37-2). If Automatic pricing=N, no prices can be

changed by either job.

O CASE comm. update, which is available when CASE Special Process
code is used and functions independent of the other 2 pricing fields. If
CASE comm. update=Y, a part's prices are updated when it is involved
in Case Communications in the following jobs: Parts Inquiry (X3-1),
Point of Sale Part Availability (X5-1 [Cmd12]). Automatic Order
Receive (X713-5) does not update parts already in inventory: it only
adds new parts (replaced by) and their descriptions and related
information.


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU [=]

### Overview Of Automatic Price Update Menu

The options on the Automatic Price Update Menu are described below:

X37-1 Reprice Parts

Changes prices of
™ one vendor one class
™ one vendor all classes
® all vendors one class
= all vendors all classes

by one of these methods
- field: base prices of one or more fields on the values of
another field, such as dealer list = 110% of suggested
list.
- value: establish markup according to ranges, such as
when the suggested list is from $500 to $999, the dealer
list will be will be 105% of suggested list.
- individual prices: a screen full of parts at a time.
® direct ship.

Reprice Parts affects only prices. Reprice Individual Parts allows you to
change a screenful of part prices without regard to the configuration in
X38-1, just as though you were working in Parts Posting & Maintenance.

Reprice By Field and By Value can be used to update all price levels for
parts in classes where Automatic pricing=Y in Vendor/Class
Configuration (X38-1).

To reprice by Direct Ship, the following conditions must be met:
0 A Direct Ship price book for the vendor must be on the hard disk.


[ «| X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU ( ma

O The price level must be selected on the Inquire/Reprice screen with
Reprice=Y and a percentage different from 100%. Note Suggested List
on the screen below.

Reprice by Direct Ship does not consider the * Automatic pricing” field in
Vendor/Class Configuration. Direct Ship parts can be repriced even if
Automatic pricing=N. Since classes with Automatic pricing=Y can be
tepriced by Reprice By Field and By Value, DIS recommends that you use
Automatic pricing=N on all Direct Ship classes.

X37-2 Price Tape Update

Manufacturers send their most current pricing information to DIS on tape. (
DIS puts the information on diskettes or tape in a format that you can use :
to change the prices on parts in your inventory files. Discontinued parts

will not be on the tape; therefore, they will not be affected in your files.

The price book on your disk is not affected by the price tape update;

however, you can use the price book to update and reprice the parts in

inventory. This feature allows you to build a price book first and

update/reprice parts from it later.

The information contained in a part's master record is displayed in Parts
Inquiry (X3-1) and Parts Posting and Maintenance (X3-2),

Provided the manufacturer's tape carries the following information, it may
be updated on the part's master record by Price Tape Update if it is in a
class where Automatic Pricing = Yes.

C1 Description. Description is updated only if it is currently blank in your

inventory files. Many dealerships enhance the descriptions furnished on
the tape and prefer not to have the information replaced every time they


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU [=]

Tun a price tape update.

O Prices. Prices are updated only if Automatic pricing=Y and Update=Y.
It is possible to block the update for any price level by entering N in the
column labeled "Update." This has no effect on repricing from Reprice
Parts, which will proceed as long as Automatic pricing=Y.

OD Part category

 

 

 

Supersede code

 

OQ Superseded by (part number)

O Weight

 

 

 

Returm code

 

O Package Quantity. Like "Description," package quantity is updated only
if it is blank.

if Automatic Pricing=N, no changes are made to prices or to the other
fields, regardless of the entry in the “Update” field.

X37-3 Display/Print/Change Price Book

If you have created a price book (see the next step), you may display,
print or change it here. You may also alter the way it is presented (set
options).


[ «| X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU

X37-4 Create/Update Price Book

If you have room, you may store the price tape on your hard disk. This is
the same information you would find in the manufacturer's price book and
is available to parts jobs and at Point of Sale. The only way you can
physically change a price book is to update it with supplementary or
supersession information. Building a price book does not affect your parts
files directly, but information can be copied from the book to the files in
some parts jobs, such as Point of Sale, PP&M, Correct Stock Order, etc.
Also, you can use the price book to update and reprice the parts in your
inventory files (see X37-2, Price Tape Update).

New Holland Price Book Update
New Holland dealers may take advantage of a DIS OPT switch to update
their price book.

X37-5 Remove Price Book

Deletes price book created above. Used to make room for other things or
End of Month jobs.

X37-6 Part Lists

Part Lists are lists of parts (and related information) that are required to do
specific jobs. The parts are not necessarily in inventory. Lists can be added
manually or uploaded from the parts catalog system. A list can be copied,
and individual parts can be added or deleted from any list. In addition,
some part information can be changed.


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU

 

X37-7 Parts Catalog Manufacturer Table

To use Part Lists with or without an external parts catalog system, set up
default codes in this job. If you are using an external system, this job also
records the code associated with the catalog.

X37-8 Agco Create Price Book

Allows you to load price information and supersession records for up to 6
different product lines from a tape cartridge to the computer system. The
price book can be used to add part numbers to your computer inventory,
look up prices, or find supersession information. In addition, you can use a
price book to update and reprice your inventory.

X37-9 Agco Price Tape Update

Allows you to update part prices and other part information, including
supersession, for up to 6 different product lines with the most current data
from a tape cartridge.

PARTS PARTS PARTS

### Files Tapes Books

In the beginning there was a manufacturer who made parts, and there was

a dealer who bought some of the parts. To illustrate this story, P = Part

currently manufactured and carried by the vendor, and d = discontinued
Part.

Manufacturer's parts: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Dealer's parts: PPPPPPP

The manufacturer published a book which showed all of the parts and their
current prices.

Manufacturer's price book: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Every dealership had a copy of this book, on paper or on microfiche.
Pretty soon the manufacturer made even more parts, but stopped making a
few parts that the dealer had bought. The discontinued parts were no
longer published in the price book.

Manufacturer's current parts: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Dealer's parts: PPPdPPddPPP

Manufacturer's price book: PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Where do price tape update diskettes come from?

‘When manufacturers change the prices on parts, they send a magnetic tape
to DIS. The price tape contains all of the manufacturer's current parts and


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU [2]

the new prices. The manufacturer uses the price tape to make the price
book (or microfiche). Discontinued parts are no longer listed.

DIS converts the information on the price tape so that it can be used by the
DIS software and sends this information to you on diskettes. The price
tapes take from | to 20 diskettes. Each diskette holds about 14,440 parts,
and even though computers are very fast, it takes a long time to do a price
update on the parts from a major manufacturer.

What to do with the price tape update diskettes (or tape):

1) First, decide whether you'd rather update inventory directly from the
Price tape update diskettes (or tape) or build a price book and then update
inventory from it.

a. From diskettes or tape. Go to Price Tape Update (X37-2) to update
the parts in your inventory files that match parts on the price tape
update diskettes. Choose the device that corresponds to your system:
diskette, magazine, or tape cartridge. Discontinued parts will not be
affected. The price book will not be affected. You can build a price
book later by selecting Create/Update Price Book (X37-4).

b. Build a price book. Go to Create/Update Price Book (X37- 4). There
are 2 options within Create/Update Price Book.

Create a price book. Use the Create option to create a brand new
price book or to replace an existing price book.

Update a price book. Use the Update option to update an existing
price book with supplemental or supersession diskettes only.

Do not use the regular price tape update diskettes, which contain
all of the manufacturer's parts, to update a book, which also


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU

contains all of the manufacturer's parts, unless you have all day to
do it.

The process of creating or updating a price book does not affect the
parts in your inventory files; however, you can use the price book to

update inventory by using Price Tape Update, X37-2. Choose the Price
Book (PB) device.

2) If you keep your discontinued parts in a separate class, you may want
to reprice them using Reprice Parts (X37-1). Periodically you may phase
these parts out using Stock Phase-Out (X35-6 through X35-10).

### Supersession

Supersession information is available in the following options:
- Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

- Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

- Display/Print/Change Price Book (X37-3)

- Point of Sale Detail Line (X5-1)

- Part Availability (Cmd12 from X5-1)

- Electronic Parts Catalogs

Except for Display/Print/Change Price Book (X37-3) and Electronic Parts
Catalogs, backward supersession is not handled. The DIS system attempts
to sell all parts from inventory in a forward chain and displays the last part
in the chain so it can be ordered, if necessary. The Electronic Parts Catalog
skips intermediate parts and displays only | level of backward and 1 level
of forward supersession (the last part in the chain).


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU [J

Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

The Supersede code "S” means the part has been superseded by a single
part. "M" means the part has been superseded by multiple parts, only the
first (alphabetically) is displayed. This information is updated by price
tape update.

Parts In Inventory

If the entire chain is in inventory, it is displayed at F7=Supersession when
the original part number is entered. If a superseding part is entered, the
chain is displayed from that part forward. You must press F5=Division to
check availability for a part in other divisions.


[| X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU

Parts Not In Inventory

If the original part number is entered, the chain is revealed from the price
book one number at a time in a message at the bottom of the screen. If a
superseding part is entered, the chain is displayed from that part forward.

Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

Parts In Inventory

Supersession information can be added to any part manuaily. This is
overwritten when inventory is updated from a price tape or price book
unless the part is in a class flagged as non-updatable (automatic pricing =
N) in Configure Vendor/Class (X38-1). In the absence of a price book, this
information is used by POS to chain to superseding parts.

Parts Not In Inventory

Parts may be added from the price book from any point in a chain. No
supersession information is retrieved, only pricing and the return code.
There is no way to know how many superseding parts there are or to go
directly to the end of the chain.

Display/Print/Change Price Book (X37-3)

The price book displays backward (supersedes) and forward (superseded
by) chains. The "M" indicator seems to mean the part supersedes many
different parts and does not correspond to the "M"” indicator used in Parts
Posting & Maintenance, which means the part is superseded by multiple
parts (kit).


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU [=]

Point of Sale Detail Screen

Point of Sale uses both local inventory and the price book to sell the first
available part in a forward chain, and always displays the last part number
in the chain. A part that has been superseded by multiple parts shows
simply *MULTIPLE*.

Part In Inventory

Availability information is displayed. If the request cannot be filled by the
first part entered, the next part in the chain with available quantity will be
displayed on the comment line. After all available parts have been sold,
the last part in the chain can be ordered.

Part Not In Inventory

Regardless of where you start in a chain, the last part in the chain is
displayed on the comment line. If it is not possible to order the part you
enter, such as AA1117, you will receive an "Invalid part" message, and the
most current part will be displayed on the comment line. If it is possible to
order the part you entered, it will be displayed on the detail line with a "P"
priority code, but the most current part number will be displayed on the
comment line.


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU C ~

Part Availability

Part in Inventory
All superseding parts in the chain that are in inventory are displayed
whether they will be needed to meet the request or not.

Part Not In Inventory

Part Availability searches local inventory, other divisions, and the price
book. All parts in the forward supersession chain will be displayed. If the
original part requested is in the requesting division's inventory but not
available, it will show "NOT OK." Parts located in the Price book will be
indented and show "NOT OK/PRC BOOK." If you left-justify the parts
and press [Enter] again, the system will search other divisions for the
superseding part and display availability information. You will be able to
order the last part in the chain, if necessary. The system will repeat the
quantity, which is adjusted manually as you decide what parts to sell.

Electronic Parts Catalog

As of 11/5/96, the DIS interface to the parts catalog displays 1 level of
backward supersession and the last part(s) in the forward chain (1 level). If
the parts listed are in the dealer's inventory, availability and bin location
are displayed. No intermediate parts are shown, regardless of whether the
part is in the dealer's local inventory or not. Multiple "Superseded by" part
numbers indicate a kit. Multiple "Supersedes" may be from a kit to one
part or simply separate parts that have been superseded by the same part.

Multiple supersession is the most difficult because manufacturers do not
make it clear whether a part is superseded by 3 different single parts or by
a kit consisting of 3 parts. In some cases, the original part number is


XL


X3-7 PRICE UPDATE/PART LISTS MENU |

superseded by several different part numbers, any one of which can be
used to replace the original part. In other cases, the original part is
superseded by a kit composed of several different part numbers, all of
which are required to do the job of the 1 original part number. In either
case, the DIS Business System displays "*MULTIPLE*" in the "Super."
field at Point of Sale. If possible, use the comment field on the Parts
Posting & Maintenance screen to store all part numbers that are required
for supersession.

Stand-alone parts catalogs (without the DIS interface) display only the last
part(s) in a forward supersession chain.

## CHAPTER X3-8

PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU

### Introduction

Parts Configuration is the key to the DIS Inventory Control system. This
section will explain some concepts used in Configure Vendor/Class and in
Reconfigure Parts, These concepts are important when configuring parts
for jobs such as Create Suggested Stock Orders, Stock Returns/Phase
Outs, and Point of Sale.

### Overview

The Parts Configuration Menu contains the following jobs:

X38-1 Configure Vendor/Class allows you to:
o add, change, and delete vendors and/or classes.
Q establish criteria used for suggested stock order
calculations.
a create sorting specifications for each vendor's part
numbers.
Oo establish mark-up percentage pricing for each class
of parts.
X38-2 Configuration Report allows you to:
Oo produce a report which lists all current options for
each vendor and class on the system.
X38-3 Reconfigure Parts allows you to:
o reconfigure an entire class/vendor or all parts.
o change the order code, class code, minimums &
maximums, or other specific fields.
a move parts from one class to another based on

user-defined performance criteria.


[| X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU

X38-4 Parts Locator Configuration allows you to:
Q to match your vendor codes with the numerical
codes used by the Parts Locator.
X38-5 Create/Save Parts Locator File allows you to:
Oo creates a file of parts from the vendors assigned to

numerical codes in Parts Locator Configuration.

Considerations - what to think of when setting up
Vendors/Classes.

1. Tracking Parts - Nearly everyone has some method of identifying
parts, either on their systems or in their heads. These parts are identified
as obsolete, stocking, non-returnable, eligible for a pre-season order,
etc. These identifications are used for what we call Class Codes.

Class Codes are used by the inventory control system for multiple

purposes. As an example, you could use Class Codes to identify all of

your seeder and tillage parts by identifying each part with the same

class code of X, for spring pre-season. You can use a letter or number

other than X. When you are ready for your large spring pre-season

order to that vendor, you can request a suggested order only for those (
parts with that Class Code. Uses other than suggested orders include

stock returns, parts that you do not want to show on suggested orders

such as obsolete parts, parts grouped by particular pricing levels, etc.

You can always change the Class Code on the part, but if you give it
some consideration now, you will start with a system using all of its
capabilities. Suggested Class Codes are given in a later section of this
handbook.

2. Control vs. Effort - Every company has certain parts of which they do
not maintain accurate records of transactions. They do this because the
costs of maintaining sales history, per piece costing and inventory
listings exceeds the benefit they would derive from knowing this
information. These types of parts typically include nuts and bolts,
washers, and other small items.

f
RELEASE 2.1 ~


X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU [=]

3. Order Codes - The DIS inventory control system uses three different
Order Codes for suggested stock orders. These codes can be changed at
any time for an entire class of parts or for individual parts within a
class. The codes are described below.

A. Manual Orders - These are parts identified with an Order Code of
'M. This code has the following characteristics and uses.

= Parts with a ‘M’ Order Code will never appear on suggested stock
orders.

® This Order Code should be used for parts classes such as
obsolete, future non-returnable, and non-stocking.

« A job in the system will allow you to automatically move
non-stocking parts in one class to a stocking class based on a
minimum demand criteria you establish.

B. Automatic - These are parts identified with an Order Code of 'A'.
This code has the following characteristics and uses.

= When a suggested stock order is requested for parts with an

"A' Order Code, demand criteria for that part's class is checked. If
the part meets the minimum demand criteria of say 2 calls in 6
months, or 3 calls in 12 months, then the part is eligible for
ordering.

= If you request a stocking period of 60 days on a suggested order,
the order quantity for each part is calculated based on. If no pieces
were sold in the stocking period 12 months ago, the order quantity
is calculated based on an average of last years sales prorated for
your 60 day stocking period.


[«| X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU ( -

= Once a quantity is calculated based on history, the order will
be adjusted for Economic Order Quantity (EOQ).

= Order quantities are also adjusted for amounts on order,
available, pieces per package, and the multiple in which the
vendor ships in a single carton or case.

= This code works best for companies with distinctly seasonal
orders.

C. Combined - These are parts identified with an Order Code of 'C.
This code has the following characteristics and uses.

™ Order quantities are based on minimum and maximum (
stocking levels you assign to each part.

= Since the combined code does not base order quantities on
seasonal history, the demand criteria for the part is not
checked.

= If minimum and maximum are assigned, the order quantities

will keep you stocked within the range of minimum and maximum.
The order quantities will be adjusted for on order, _ available, per
package, and vendor multiple.

= If maximum only is assigned, the order quantity will always be
the maximum, adjusted for the amount on order, available, per
package, and vendor multiple.

= If minimum only is assigned, the order quantity will be at
least the minimum, adjusted for the amount on order, available,

Lo


X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU [7]

per package, and vendor multiple.

"If no minimum or maximum are assigned, the order quantity
will be based on an average of last years sales prorated for the
requested stocking period. This is similar to the automatic method,
except the quantities will usually be larger.

= If you have any sales history on a part within the last 12 months,
you will get a suggested order quantity for that part, adjusted
for EOQ, on order, available, per package, and vendor multiple.

= This Order Code is useful for a non-seasonal business since it
keeps stock on hand based on a moving average of the last 12
months sales.

= This Order Code should not be used for a business that has a
highly seasonal nature since it would leave you under stocked
when your peak period arrives.

4. Suggested Order Codes - The following are suggested order codes for
businesses based on whether there sales are seasonal or non-seasonal.

A. Seasonal Sales - Primarily agricultural equipment dealers with
distinct seasonal sales history. Also for businesses that order based
on sales history in the same period last year.

= Automatic - Select the 'A' order code for all normal stocking
classes.

= Manual - Select the 'M' order code for classes that you do not

want to appear on stock orders. These include classes for
obsolete, non-stocking, etc.


X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU co

B. Non-Seasonal Sales - These types of companies include
agricultural dealers without distinct seasonal fluctuations,
construction equipment dealers, truck, auto, etc. Also for any
businesses that do not want to order based on demand in the
similar period last year.

= Combined - Select the 'C' Order Code for all normal stocking
classes. Give consideration to minimum and maximum stocking
levels for each part.

= Manual - Select the 'M' Order Code for classes that you do not
want to appear on stock orders. These include classes for obsolete,
non-stocking, etc.

Selecting Vendors

From reading the previous section, you probably have selected the vendors
that you want to have on your system. You've probably also given some
thought to the class groupings within each vendor.

This section will help you finalize your selection of major vendors and
short-line vendors. We'll also discuss the effects of grouping short-line
vendors under one vendor code and the meaning of miscellaneous parts.

1. Major Vendors - These are vendors of your major lines of parts. They
will have their own Vendor Codes and several Class Codes. Evaluate
each vendor to determine the Class Codes in which you will categorize
parts and the Order Codes for each of those classes.

2. Short-Line Vendors - These are all of the other vendors from which you

{
RELEASE 2.1 ~


X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU [2]

purchase parts other than your major vendors. The number of part lines
for each vendor can vary from less than a dozen to thousands.

For your large short-line vendors, treat them the same as your major
vendors. That is, give them their own Vendor Code and Class Codes.

For your small short-line vendors, those with less than a few hundred
part lines, you have a choice of giving each vendor its own Vendor
Code or grouping them all together under one Vendor Code.

The following examples should give you an understanding of the
advantages and disadvantages of grouping vendors under one code.

A. Example 1 - Company XYZ has a small auto parts business in their
dealership. They carry hundreds of brands of short-line auto parts.
Each brand has it's own part numbering system and price book. All
the brands are purchased from one distributor. Should they assign a
Vendor Code to each brand-line or should they group them all
together under one Vendor Code?

= Separate vs. Single Vendor Codes -

 

 

 

 

Separate Vendor Codes -

im The system will provide management reports
concerning sales activities and stocking levels for
each line.

Your parts-pad print outs will match the numbering

sequence for each manufacturers price book.
o You will have to run a suggested stock order for
each line even though they all go to the same

## X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU C

distributor.
Oo Your counter people will have to remember over a
hundred extra vendor codes when they use Point of

Sale.

Single Vendor Code -

Oo You will only have to produce a single suggested
stock order to the distributor.

 

 

Your counter people will only have to remember

one vendor code for all the lines.

oO Maintenance on the parts is much easier with only

one vendor code.

Management reports will combine all the vendors

sales activities and stocking levels.

Parts-pad print outs may not match the {
manufacturers price books.

 

 

 

 

 

 

For this particular situation, we would probably recommend the
use of only one Vendor Code. The effort to produce hundreds of
suggested stock orders, all going to the same distributor, far out
weigh the benefits derived from multiple Vendor Codes.

'

\

### X3-8 Parts Configuration Menu [*]

B. Example 2 - Whoever company has 20 different short-line vendors.
They purchase regularly from only 5 of the vendors. The other 15
are only sent orders on an infrequent basis and the order quantities
usually are under a dozen lines. How should they assign vendor
codes?

“ Separate and Single Vendor Codes -

Separate Vendor Codes -

The five vendors that the company purchases from
on a regular basis should be assigned their own
Vendor Codes. Separate Vendor Codes will allow
separate stock orders for each vendor.

 

 

 

 

Single Vendor Code -

o The remaining 15 vendors should be grouped under
one Vendor Code. The number of lines and the
amount of activity per vendor do not warrant having
separate Vendor Codes.

Oo Use the Category Code on the Parts Data Entry
Form to identify the individual vendor's parts
grouped under the one Vendor Code.

3. Miscellaneous Parts - There are certain parts that you may elect not to
put on the system. These parts as described earlier include nuts and
bolt, washers, and other similar small parts. If you did not have these
parts on your previous system, then they probably should not be
included in your new system. You will still be able to sell these parts at
Point of Sale, but the costing will be based on a established percentage
of the sale rather than actual costing. The trade- off here is ease of
maintenance vs. management information.


[| X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU C

Selecting Classes -

Class Codes are used by the system for suggested stock orders, stock
returns, and stock phase-outs. They are also used to group parts by
mark-up pricing levels. When you determine what classes you wish to
establish, you should take into account the following considerations.

O Do you want the part to appear on suggested stock orders?
0 Do you want to order based on sales history or by assigned minimums
and maximums?

O What pricing bracket does this part fall under? What ranges of dealer
mark-up are you going to establish?

C7 Is this part usually ordered under a special manufacturers program? Do
you get discounts if this part is ordered under a pre-season order or a
ship direct program?

Suggested Classes -
1. Stocking - This class will either have an 'A' or 'C' Order Code.

2. Non-Stocking - This class should have a 'M' Order Code. This class
is also the default class for the vendor. Any new part numbers
added from Point of Sale will be entered into this class and will
remain there until you assign it to another class.

3. New Stock - This class should have either a 'C’ or 'M' Order Code.
Since new parts do not have enough history to use the 'A' Order
Code, you must either use the Combined Order Code with a min
and/or max or review parts on a manual basis to order.

tos


X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU [3]

4. Special Ordering - You may have several classes that divide parts
based on ship direct programs or pre-season ordering programs.
These classes will have either an 'A' or 'C’ Order Code.

5. Special Pricing - You may have more than one of these classes to
divide parts into price mark-up ranges. If you have parts that you
must competitively price, group them into a class with a common
mark-up percentage. Use 'A' or 'C’ Order Codes.

6. Obsolete - This class has a ‘M' Order Code to keep obsolete parts
from appearing on suggested orders.

Part Number Configuration

‘The purpose of part number configuration is to ensure that the part
numbers you load into the computer match your vendor's price book. This
will result in part reports, such as parts pads, that match the numbering
sequence of your vendor. If your vendor does not provide a price tape,
matching the configuration is helpful when it comes time to manually
update your prices. The part numbers on your system will be in exactly the
same sequence as their new price list.

1. Segment Sizes - Part numbers on the DIS system can be up to 18
characters long. Segment Sizes allows you to break these numbers up
into 1, 2, 3, or 4 segments. Each segment can contain up to 18
characters, but the total for all four segments cannot exceed 22
characters. For example, if we have a 1 segment part number, that
segment can contain up to 18 characters. If we have a 2 segment part
number, the total of the 2 segments cannot exceed 18. One segment
could contain 4 characters and the other 14.

The examples below show an 18 digit part number in one, two, and
four segments.

Segment Sizes

One Segment- —123456789123456789 18 00 00 00
Two Segments - 1234 56789123456789 04 18 00 00
1 23456789123456789 04 18 00 00
Four Segments - 123 4567891 2345678 9 03 07 07 05

123 45678 91234 56789 03 07 07 05

In the example above with four segment parts, there are two part numbers


X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU Cc

that are 18 characters long.

The first four segment part is different from the second due to the number
of digits in each segment. To the right of the part number, you will notice
that the total for the four segment sizes is 22. The first part number has 3
digits in the first segment, 7 in the second, 7 in the third and 1 in the last.
The second part has 3 digits in the first segment, and 5 in the next 3. Both
part numbers are 18 characters long. They have only been segmented
differently. The segment sizes were configured to be large enough to hold
the largest possible segment sizes.

Pay particular attention when establishing your Segment Sizes. Unlike
other options in Vendor/Class Configuration, Segment Sizes are extremely
difficult to change.

2. Sort Justification - Sort justification can be either 'R’ for right, or 'L' for
left. The best way to describe how this works is by looking at the

example below.
Right Justified Left Justified
2 10
10 100
11 3]
13 111
21 13
100 131
111 2
131 21

Right justified numbers are in normal numeric sequence. The sequence
can also include characters besides numbers. The system will sort in order
of blanks first, then special characters (like @), then letters and finally

LL.

## X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU

numbers.

Left justified numbers group numbers together by similar first digits. All
numbers beginning with 1 would group together before any numbers
starting with 2.

Now that we have seen a fairly simple example of left and right
justification, we'll go on to the more difficult example below.

Right Justified Left Justified

10010 A20010
10100 A20100
20010 B10010
20020 B10100
20200 10010
A20010 100100
A20100 10100
B10010 20010
B10100 20020
100100 20200

Notice again that the right justified column is in straight numerical
sequence. The left justified column sorts in increasing order on the digits
from left to right. When left justified, see how the number 100100 sorts
before 10100. This is because the larger number has a 0 in the third digit,
whereas the smaller number has a 1 in the third digit.


The following examples will break these parts into 3 segments. The first
segment will be the prefix letter. The second and third segments will
divide the rest of the part number. In addition to breaking the Part into
segments, we can also assign justification to each segment.

R L R R R L
10 100 10 100
100 10 20 200
100 100 100 10
20 200 100 100
200 10 200 10
200 20 200 20
A 20 100 aA 20 100
A 200 10 A 200 10
B 10 100 B 10 100
B 100 10 B 100 10

Here are the same part numbers again. This time they are broken into three
segments. Notice that the two columns have sorted differently because of
our sort justifications on each segment. The first column was sorted right,
left, right. The second was sorted right, right, left.

‘When you examine your vendor's price books, segments are sometimes
easy to identify by spaces within the part numbers. Justification is usually
also easy to identify. But sometimes there seems to be no sense to how a
manufacturer sorts their parts in a price book. This is due to segment sort
order.

The next section describes segment sort order and how it combines with

segment sizes and justification to produce the same sorting sequences as
your manufacturer.


3. Segment Sort Order - This option allows you to specify the order in
which the segments will sort. Rather than having the first segment
sorted first, you could have it sorted third. Our previous examples of
three segment parts had the segments sorted 1,2,3. The following
example takes the same parts that were justified R,L,R in the previous
example and sorts them in order of 3,1,2.

RoL R RL R
1 2 3 31 2
10 100 10 100
100 10 B10 100
100 100 100 10
20 200 B 100 10
200 10 100 100
200 20 A 20 100
A 20 100 20 200
A 200 10 200 10
B 10 100 A 200 10
B 100 10 200 20

If your vendor's price book has part numbers that occasionally have prefix
or suffix letters or numbers, you will most probably have to change your
Sort Order. In the right hand column above, that has parts sorted 3,1,2,
notice how part number 100 10 is followed by B 100 10. Sorting in this
order keeps similarly numbered parts together despite prefix or suffix
numbers.

When you fill in the information requested under Part Number
Configuration, remember to fill in all the blanks. If your part numbers are
only i segment, write in the size of the first segment and the 00 for the
remaining 3 segments. Remember that the total for all four segments
cannot exceed 22 characters.

For Sort Justification, write L or R for left or right justification for each of


[=| X3-8 PARTS CONFIGURATION MENU

your segments. If you only have one segment, write L or R in the first field
and 0's in the remaining 3.

For Segment Sort Order, write the order you want your segments sorted. If
you have one segment, write 1 in the first field and 0's in the rest.

## CHAPTER X3-11

PARTS END OF YEAR MENU

### Introduction

Parts End of Year Menu contains the options to finish the year for the Parts
Department. LIFO End of Year jobs, X3-i1.2 and X3-11.3 are run

at the end of the fiscal year. Parts End of Year X3-11.1 is run at the
calendar year end.

### Overview

The Parts End of Year Menu contains three jobs:
X3-11.1 Parts End of Year:

Parts End of Year allows you to delete parts sales history that is 24
months or older. It organizes and compresses the parts files. It
builds the history columns (buckets) viewed at Parts Inquiry (X3-1)
and Parts Posting and Maintenance (X3-2) for the next year. This is
a calendar year end job.

X3-11.2 LIFO End of Year: |

LIFO End of Year prints four reports that can be used for tax
reporting. The purpose of the job is to calculate the LIFO value of
your current year's inventory. The value of the current inventory and
previous year's inventory is estimated in base year dollars. A factor
of inflation is calculated and the current dollar value of your
inventory is printed for comparison. This is a fiscal year end job.

X3-11.3 LIFO Setup Procedure:

LIFO Setup Procedure allows you to do the initial setup of the LIFO
files. You will add all parts vendors, enter the base year for


[2] X4-11 PARTS END OF MONTH PROCEDURES C

inventory valuation, and choose the year you need LIFO reports for.
This job only has to be done once. However, if you add new part
vendors, they will need to be added to the LIFO system. LIFO is a
fiscal year end job.

If you want to know more about LIFO, read the following sections
carefully.

### The Theory Of Lifo

When reporting cost of sales for tax purposes, most accountants use the
following formula:

Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Sales (

If it works to your advantage to report a higher cost of sales, therefore
lowering the margins on sales, the LIFO program helps by providing an
estimated LIFO value of the ending inventory for use in the above equation.

LIFO means Last In First Out. In terms of inventory, it means that the last
part added to a part bin cost more than the first part added to that bin. LIFO
assumes that the parts sold have the value of the last part placed in the bin.
A higher cost of sales results. For example, if a part cost $.80 in 1996 and
now the cost is $1.00, LIFO allows the cost of sale to reflect the current
cost of $1.00. This lowers the inventory value and raises the cost of sales,
lowering the sales margins.

There are three reasons that your parts inventory totals could increase
from one year to another:

1. New parts are added to inventory (capital increases).

Co


X3-11 PARTS END OF MONTH PROCEDURES [2]

2. Changes to quantities of parts already on hand (capital increases).
3. Cost increases to inventory (inflationary increases).

What LIFO End of Year does is to wring the inflation out of the parts
inventory total for tax reporting purposes.

Looking at the equation again:
Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Sales

When the accountant is using the LIFO inventory method, the object is to
lower the Ending Inventory figure, thereby raising the Cost of Sales.


[+] X3-11 PARTS END OF MONTH PROCEDURES

### How Is This Done?

Below is a table containing figures for four years to illustrate how LIFO

works:

other totals on the table are for the last day of

X3-11 PARTS END OF MONTH PROCEDURES |

Parts Inventory Pad The total of the inventory on the Summary of
the Parts Pad (X36-1).

Factor The factor is the percentage of cost that a part
purchased in the current year would have cost
if purchased in the Base Year.

Base Year The value of the current inventory in base
year dollars. You have to start somewhere. In
the table, 1995 is the Base Year.

Assume that in 1995, the value of the
inventory is the actual cost. From 1995
forward, all inventory costs are based on
what the inventory was worth in 1995.

In the table, the 1995 inventory figure was
worth $5000. However, in 1996, inventory on
the Part Pad Summary is $10,000. You could
have purchased the same parts in 1995 for
90% (Factor) of what they cost you in 1996.

To arrive at the cost of 1996's inventory in
1995 dollars, multiply $10,000 (Parts Pad
Inventory) by 90% (Factor). The result is the
Base Year value of the inventory total for

1996.
Capital Inventory Incr Increase in the inventory in base year
(Base Year Dollar) dollars. In other words, the increase in dollar

value of the inventory if the dollar was worth
the same in 1996 as it was in 1995.


[<] X3-11 PARTS END OF MONTH PROCEDURES

Capital Inventory Incr
(Current Year Dollars)

G/L Year End

Again looking at the table for 1995 and 1996.
The Base Year value of inventory in 1995
was $5,000. In 1996 the Base Year value of
inventory (Parts Pad Inventory, 10,000,
multiplied by the Factor (90%), equals Base
Year) was $9,000.

To find the Capital Increase in inventory in
Base Year dollars, subtract the Base Year
value of inventory for 1995, (5,000), from the
Base Year value of inventory for 1996,
(9,000). The result is $4,000.

The inventory increase to this point has

been figured in Base Year dollar value. To
report taxes for the current year, you have to
know the value of the increase in inventory in
current year dollars.

To calculate this figure divide the Capital
Increase in inventory in base year dollars by
the factor.

Look at the table in 1996. Divide 4,000 by
90%. The result is $4,444,

The Parts Inventory Ending total from the
previous year plus the Capital Inventory
Increase (Current Year Dollars).

In 1996, the G/L total would be $9,444.


X3-11 PARTS END OF MONTH PROCEDURES 7]

5,000 (G/L Year End Inventory Value for
1995) plus 4,444 (Capital Increase in Current
Year Dollars in 1996).
The Ending Inventory value for 1996 (G/L
Year End Inventory Value) is $9,444 because
of the LIFO adjustment. Without the LIFO
adjustment the Ending Inventory figure
would be $10,000
In terms of the reporting equation:
Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Sales
In 1996, if you did not use LIFO, the equation would contain the following
figures:
Beginning Inventory + Purchases - 10,000 = Cost of Sales
In 1996, using LIFO, the equation would contain the following:
Beginning Inventory + Purchases - 9,444 = Cost of Sales

The Ending Inventory is lower and the Cost of Sales is higher, reducing
the profit margin on sales.

Using the above formulas, see if you can arrive at the figures used in the
table for 1997 and 1998.


Le] X3-11_ PARTS END OF MONTH PROCEDURES C

WHAT THE LIFO PROGRAM DOES:

The LIFO program provides LIFO figures for each vendor entered at LIFO
Setup procedure. The parts files are searched. Parts that were in inventory
are examined for cost changes from base year to current year.

The inventory parts are compared to the parts in the LIFO files to calculate
the value of your current inventory in base year dollars. Also, a factor or
percentage is calculated to show cost differences between current and base
year inventory values.

The LIFO files created by the program, u.ILM LIFO Master File and u.JLA

LIFO Detail File (u = your User ID), operate independently of system parts

files. Information stored in the LIFO files is not used to update any other (
parts files.

The LIFO files are large. If you have disk space problems, you may want to
save the LIFO files u.{LM and u.ILA (u = your user Id) on diskette when
you are not using them. You can restore them when you need to use them.

PARTS END OF YEAR

### Introduction

Parts End of Year allows you to delete parts sales history that is more than
24 months old and free disk space. Parts End of Year is a CALENDAR
YEAR END job not a fiscal year end job. It organizes and compresses the
parts files. All divisions are processed at the same time. Although
technically the requirement is that no parts or point of sale jobs can be
running, DIS recommends a dedicated system because of the size of the
files involved. You can expect the procedure to take 1 4 - 2 hours
depending on the number of parts you carry.

Run Parts End of Year after January 1. Do not change the date on your
terminal.

### Preparation

 

 

 

Backup your data files.

 

O Run Parts End of Day Procedures (X3-9). If it was run with backup,
there is no need to run it again. History is updated when Parts End of
Day is run.

OQ S/36 only. Compress the data on the disk. This will organize your disk
and provide maximum free blocks in one place. No other jobs can be
running. At a DIS menu type: COMPRESS [Enter].

## CHAPTER X3.11-2

LIFO END OF YEAR

### Introduction

LIFO End of Year will print four reports that can be used for tax reporting.
The purpose of the job is to calculate the LIFO value of your current year's
inventory. The value of the current inventory and previous year's inventory
is estimated in base year dollars. A factor of inflation is calculated and the
current dollar value of your inventory is printed for comparison. This is a
fiscal year end job.

Before LIFO End of Year can be run, you must first run LIFO Setup
Procedure (X3.11-3). If you have never setup LIFO, do so before
proceeding. If you have run LIFO Setup Procedure and run it again, the
information for vendors already in the file will be deleted and replaced
with new information.

If you have added any new part lines, the vendors must be added to the
LIFO files before LIFO End of Year will be calculated for those vendors.
If you have not done so, proceed to LIFO Setup Procedure (X3.11-3) to
add new vendors.

If you have any questions regarding the theory of LIFO, refer to Chapter
X3-11, Parts End of Year Menu, The Theory of LIFO,

### Preparation

 

 

If LIFO Setup Procedure (X3.11-3) has never been run, do so before
proceeding. This includes entering any new vendors added to your
inventory in the current year to the LIFO files.

0 Runa Net or List Price Missing report (X36-3).

Run an On Hand Quantity Report (X36-5) requesting parts with zero on
hand or negative on hand.

1 Correct any missing “net" prices in Parts Posting and Maintenance
(X3-2). Correct any inventory count problems from the On Hand
Quantity Report (X36-5).


[=| X3.11-2 LIFO END OF YEAR

O Rerun the Net or List Price Missing Report (X36-3) and the On Hand
Quantity Report (X36-5). The LIFO procedure only considers parts that
have the Net price recorded and have an on hand quantity greater than
or equal to zero.

O IfLIFO Setup Procedure has been run before and the files have been
saved on diskette, restore the files. The LIFO files are u.ILA, LIFO
Detail File and u.ILM, LIFO Master File (u = your user ID).

### How To Run

Make sure no other LIFO, Parts or Point of Sale jobs are running.

From the Parts End of Year Menu, select option 2, LIFO End of Year can
be run for all divisions or each division separately.

If you have not run LIFO Setup Procedure (X3.11-2) or you have not
restored your LIFO files, the following screen will display:

LIFO YEAR FND

Your LIFO files are not on the computer.

You mst either restore the files fron diskette or run the LIFO setup proceduxe to
create the files,

Press ENTER to cancel this job and return t. the mem.

 

To restore LIFO files saved on diskette, u.ILA and u.ILM (u = your User
ID), do the following:

The parts inventory is constantly changing. What you are showing in parts
inventory on January 31, 1987 will not be the same as what you had in
inventory on December 31, 1986. If the LIFO procedure was run for the
current fiscal year, current year information was placed in the file as of
that date. If you take the option to update the files, the information
recorded on December 31, 1986 will be overridden with information that
is current as of January 31, 1987.

Choose which reports you wish to receive ; enter "¥" or "N":

For example, the following reports were created running LIFO on one
vendor. Your reports will contain information for all the vendors you
entered in LIFO Setup Procedure (X3.11-3). To print the Preliminary
Reports, Y must be entered in the "Update Files” field. If N is entered,
only Final reports will print.

 

 

 

Preliminary Detail Report:

 

This report will list all parts in inventory that were not in the LIFO
file last year. Any parts for new vendors added to the LIFO files in
LIFO Setup Procedure (X311.3) in the current will appear on the
report. It also lists all the parts with zero cost or negative on hand
quantities.

Some of the parts on the report should be on the report. If you have
added new parts to your inventory, any new part lines added to
inventory since LIFO was last run and parts with zero cost such as


obsolete parts.

On the report below, the parts are either obsolete (have no class) or
new parts added to inventory for the Steiger vendor.

## CHAPTER X3.11-3

LIFO SETUP PROCEDURE

### Introduction

LIFO Setup Procedure will allow you to do initial setup of the LIFO files.
You will add all parts vendors, enter the base year for inventory valuation
and choose the year you need LIFO reports for. This job only has to be
done once. However, if you add part lines, the vendors will need to be
added to the LIFO system. LIFO is a fiscal year end job.

When you perform LIFO Setup, you choose the year to be used as your
base year. The factor for that year would be 100%. Inventory cost in the
base year is 100% of that year's cost.

The factor for future years will be calculated by the LIFO End of Year
procedure (X3.11-2).

If you have any questions on how LIFO functions, refer to Chapter X3-11,
Parts End of Year, The Theory of LIFO.

### Preparation

O Two files are created when LIFO End of Year Set Up is performed.
They are u.ILA, LIFO Detail File and u.ILM, LIFO Master File. (as
your User ID).

Check a catalog. If you have performed this job before and the files are
not on the disk, restore them from the diskette they were saved on. If
the files are on the disk of the computer, you may proceed.

If you have never performed this job, the files will build

automatically.

with LIFO will be gone.

If you have added a new parts line to your
inventory since last year, that vendor must
be added to your LIFO Setup. Type in the
vendor code set up in Configure
Vendor/Class (X38-1).

Defauits to the current system year. Enter
the year for which LIFO is being calculated.
Base year is used for inventory cost
comparison. LIFO, in future years, will use
the cost associated with inventory in the
base year to calculate the factor. If the factor
is 90% it means the same parts bought in the
base year would have been 90% of the cost
of the current year's cost.

The Base Year cannot be greater than the
Current Year.

If using Lifo for the first time:

If you are setting up LIFO for the first time,
the base year will usually be the same as the
"Current Year". The parts in current
inventory are based on the base year's costs,
because base year is the current year.

If adding a vendor:

Use the same base year for this vendor as


[ «| X3.11-3 LIFO SETUP PROCEDURE

you have for vendors already in file.

If you are using LIFO, but have never used
the program:

Use the year you are currently reporting as
your base year.

Factor: Percentage of current year dollar cost that
the same inventory purchased in current year
would have cost in the base year.

parts are transferred if the Average Costing Enhancement OPT (X6332-
7) is on.

O Specify the "To" division. The class you're transferring from must also
exist in the "To" division. For example, if you're transferring parts from
Division A, Class A to Division B, then Class A must already be set up
to receive them. Pricing for the transferred part is taken from the
division that the part was transferred from. If the part already exists in
the ‘to’ division, the 'to' division price will be overwritten!

## CHAPTER X3

PARTS OVERVIEW

### Introduction

The Parts Inventory Control Menu is a major functional area of the
integrated DIS System. It features automatic and error free calculations of
part quantities and reports that allow you to see where you are at all times.
In addition, it provides a stock order and receipt system that minimizes
manual work and helps keep your parts stocking levels efficient. When
used with Point Of Sale, information within the Parts System is updated
by transactions during invoicing.

MENU SUMMARIES

X3-1 Parts Inquiry

 

Parts Inquiry allows on-screen viewing of up- to-date information
concerning parts in the DIS System. Information includes
quantities available, reservations, on order and return quantities,
supersessions, sales history and pricing levels.

X3-2 Parts Posting & Maintenance

Parts Posting & Maintenance enables you to make changes to
existing parts or to add new parts to the Inventory Control System.
Many of these transactions, including updates to quantities
available and sales history, are updated automatically from Point
Of Sale Invoicing.

X3-3 Parts Inventory Adjustment Menu

This menu contains jobs which allow you to take physical
inventories on selected ranges of part numbers or bin locations. An
option provides reports of part numbers skipped during the
adjustment process. The Inventory Freeze provides a snapshot of

X3-7

your parts inventory, which allows you to produce the Variation
Report following physical inventory or price update.

Stock Order Menu

Suggested Stock Orders are calculated according to sales history
and current performance, then are checked and corrected by the
parts manager. Order criteria can be adjusted by the operator.
Order Receipt allows for quick order adjustment for backorders,
overstock and cancelled parts and then prints a report linking
received parts to reservations and optional stocking list. Inventory
is automatically updated.

Stock Return/Phase-Out Menu

Suggested Stock Returns are calculated based on specified
numbers of months of no sales, minimum dollar value of parts and
maximum value of return order. It is manually checked and
corrected by the parts manager. A final report prints for shipment
and record keeping. Retums are automatically posted to inventory
after approval. Phase-Outs work in a similar fashion, but also
removes the part information from the system.

Parts Report Menu

Several managerial reports are available on the Parts Report Menu.
The Parts Management Report provides key decision making
information on inventory activities for each vendor in the System.

All the reports are available at any time and are always up-to-date.

Automatic price update supports a variety of manufacturer
distributed price tapes for quick update of your parts. Reprice Parts
allows mass price-update for selected categories of parts. Price
Books allow for adding an entire manufacturer's parts information
on your system.

Parts Configuration Menu

Parts configuration is the key to the DIS Inventory Control System.
The overview in this section will explain some concepts used in
Configure Vendor/Class and in Reconfigure Parts. These concepts
are important when configuring parts for jobs such as Create
Suggested Stock Order, Stock Return/Phase-Outs, and Point Of
Sale. In addition, Parts Locator options are located on this menu.

End of Day Procedures

Parts End of Day Procedures perform file maintenance to update
information on your parts. It also produces audit trail reports which
detail all activities within the Inventory Control System.

End of Month Procedures

Parts End of Month Procedures rebuild and compress your parts
information into a more efficient structure within the system.

End of Year Menu

Options on this menu allow you to delete part sales history older
than 24 months, rebuild and compress part information into a more
efficient structure, and run procedures to establish LIFO inventory
valuation.


 

### Establishing Parts Procedures

This section provides some suggestions on establishing procedures for use
by your company's parts department.

System procedures are an important, but often neglected area in the
operations of any computer system. Installing a computer system often
brings integration for the first time to many companies operations. With a
manual system, departments usually work almost independently of one
another. The individual departments are only responsible for providing
other departments with certain bits of information at certain times. A
computer system brings a requirement for integration of information. One
department becomes responsible for the input of certain information
before another department can perform its responsibilities.

Benefits from establishing procedures include:
= Eliminating conflicts on the usage of the system.

= Reducing the time it takes to perform jobs.
= Establishing clear responsibilities so jobs are sure to be performed.

RELEASE 2.1 og


 

### Establishing Responsibilities

Establishing responsibilities allows for defining clear-cut lists of duties for
each person who uses the system. These lists aid in improving the
efficiency of each department's operations.

The primary concern for establishing responsibilities is to make sure that
certain jobs will be performed on the system. Without having
responsibilities defined, you may have duplication of duties or, worse yet,
certain duties for which nobody is responsible.

The first step in establishing responsibilities is to identify what everyone's
current responsibilities are. This can be done by creating a list of each
person's current duties on the system. Once you have created these lists,
any overlaps or gaps in responsibilities will become evident. Correcting
these gaps or overlaps will give you a new list of assigned responsibilities
for each person.


 

### Establishing Procedure Checklists

The primary purpose of establishing procedure checklists is to document
what people have learned about operating the system. Each person who
works with the computer knows certain details of the system operation that
are very valuable to the operations of the company. Documenting the way
you perform certain jobs helps when someone is away due to vacation or
illness and when it comes time to train new employees.

Individuals are sometimes reluctant to share the knowledge they have
about operating the computer. They mistakenly believe that by keeping
this information to themselves, they will enhance or secure their own
positions within the company. This idea is detrimental to both the
individual and the company. For the individual, this means that they can (
never be ill or go on vacation without their work back-logging on their
desks. It also means that they lock themselves into one position within the
company. For the company, it means that they are entirely dependent on
one person to perform certain functions. What if that person becomes ill or
wishes to retire? It also does not allow for any growth paths for people
within the company.

After having established responsibilities from the previous section, you
can now create checklists of all of the identified parts functions on the
system. Each person who has the most experience running certain jobs
should write down each detailed key stroke and decision that they make
when they run a job. After writing down the steps needed to run a job, the
checklist should be checked for accuracy and then given to a person
inexperienced to see if they can actually run the job without error. Collect
these checklists into confidential binders. Access to this information may
have to be controlled if each procedure contains passwords.

RELEASE 2.1 a


 

### Scheduling Jobs

Developing a calendar schedule of jobs to be performed ensures that jobs
will always be run on time and in the proper sequence.

After having examined your individual responsibilities and checklists of
procedures, you can now incorporate all of this information into calendars
of events for your department. This process should be done for each
department using the DIS System. This will ensure that each department
will have a schedule which specifies when jobs need to be run that affect
the schedules of other departments.

Create a schedule calendar by marking a large sheet of paper with blocks
for seven days and four weeks. Within the blocks, write down procedures
on the days that they should be performed along with a primary and
secondary person responsible for running the jobs. You should consider
how certain jobs affect other departments and the sequence in which jobs
should be run.

The critical procedures table and the suggested schedules on the following
pages will help in developing your calendar of jobs.

numbers) with miscellaneous sales codes

### Integrating Departments

Certain procedures on the system affect other departments within your
company. Identifying critical jobs allows you to schedule jobs in
sequences that minimizes disruptions and conflicts.

The Critical procedures Table in this section lists jobs that require special
attention. The applications listed on the left require that the jobs listed
under exclusions not be run at the same time. As an example, when
running Reprice Parts, make sure that not other parts or Point of Sale jobs

are running.

The most common problem people have with critical procedures is with
the Point Of Sale Posting Batch. We can see from the Critical Procedures
Table that certain jobs must be excluded from the system when this job is
run. Since the posting batch is taking information from all the closed but
not posted documents from the Point Of Sale SAM file, other jobs that
access the SAM file must be excluded. These jobs include Point Of Sale
End of Month, which clears all closed and posted documents and the
Cmd2 - Print and Close procedure from the Point Of Sale Invoicing
program.

Since the Print and Close function of Point Of Sale needs to be excluded,
you either have to train your people not to close documents during the
creation of the posting batch or you need to shut down Point Of Sale
completely. The safest thing to do is to shut down Point Of Sale
completely. Someone may accidentally Print and Close during the batch
creation. If you create the posting batch during the middle of the day, you
may be greatly inconveniencing the parts counter. You need to decide on
the time of day that would least interrupt Point Of Sale activities. Most
users shut down the parts counter right before doing back-up for the
evening. This may be at 4:30 or 5:00.

Some suggested procedures are listed below:

Point Of Sale Posting Batch

{1 Shut down the parts counter at 4:30 or 5:00. Write invoices by hand if
necessary.

QO) Count the till.

O Run back-up without End-of-Day (runs faster).


 

 

Run End-of-Day Procedures (parts and accounting).

0 Hold the print spool for printing the next morning.

 

Run Create Point Of Sale Posting Batch.

 

CQ Review and Post the batch the next morning.

 

 

 

Next moming, have the parts counter recreate manual tickets on the
system if necessary.

 

Handling New Parts
This sequence of steps will ensure that information concerning new parts
will be in the system when needed. (

Many companies have a problem when adding new part numbers to the
system. These are new parts added during Point of Sale or during the
creation of a stock order. When a new part to added to the system, further
information conceming the part still needs to be entered.

What usually happens is that a new part will be added to a stock order. The
order will be finalized and placed with the vendor without anybody
updating the information on the new parts. When the parts are received,
someone will receipt them to the system without updating the information.
When receipted, the parts are ready to sell. When the part number is
requested at Point of Sale, there will be no selling price, bin location or
description. The person selling the part will have to quickly look up the
Price to enter manually on the screen. This will allow him to sell the part
but there will be no costing when the posting batch is processed. The
bookkeeper will then ask the parts department to look up the cost on the
part so the accounting batch can be corrected. After looking up the cost,

RELEASE 2.1 _


 

the parts department will finally update the pricing information in the
system.

The result of this process is more work for everyone.

The following sequence of steps will avoid the selling of parts at Point of
Sale that do not have assigned costs. By updating parts information and
pricing during the creation of the order, new parts will always be ready to
be sold immediately upon the receipt of the order.

From Priority Orders

 

Review the Priority Order. Use the Cmd5 option to update any parts
without price or description.

 

 

 

 

Print the order.

 

O Verify Priority Order for any parts still missing description or pricing.
Update the information at Parts Posting & Maintenance before the parts
are receipted.

 

 

 

When receipting the order, use the Cmd5 option to update
supersessions or any other discrepancies between what was ordered and
received.

 

From Stock Orders

O If any new parts are added manually to the order, use the Cmd5 option
to update any parts without price or description. This will also ensure
valid dollar totals on the printed final order.

 

 

 

Verify the final order for any parts missing description or pricing


 

information. Use Parts Posting & Maintenance to update information
before the parts are receipted.

C1 Upon receipting the order, use the Cmd5 option to update supersession
information or discrepancies between what was ordered and received.

In addition, run the Dealer Net or List Price Missing Report (X36-3) on a
regular basis to check for any parts missing pricing information.

The Target Marketing Menu provides you with a complete telemarketing
package, including the ability to do follow-up work on existing customers
and to pinpoint those who have made specific purchases.

In order to have access to Target Marketing, the Target Marketing option
must first be set, which is in the OPT DIS Library (X6-3). Select option 2,
Marketing. Select option 7, Target Marketing is installed.

After the Target Marketing OPT has been turned on and a new or existing
customer is brought up in Target Marketing, an "M" edit code is added in
position 2. Later, if you decide to stop using Target Marketing and turn off
the OPT, the "M" edit code is removed.

### Overview

The Target Marketing Menu contains the following jobs:

X4.10-1

X4.10-2

X4,10-3

X4.10-4

Target Marketing

This job allows you to view and maintain records about
existing and potential customers. Information concerning
your customer's location, previous transactions, unit sales
(whether or not your dealership sold the unit) is made
readily available with this job.

Marketing Information/Call Sheets

This job prints a call sheet for each selected customer.
Each sheet includes information such as the customer's
name, address, phone number, sales-to-date, unit(s), and
topic of call(s).

Marketing Territory Summary Report

This job produces a listing of the name, city, address, phone
number, and date of last call for selected customers.

of territory, postal code, city, sales person, and S.LC. code.

Salesperson Itinerary Listing

This job produces a report that includes the name, city,
address, phone number, contact person, topic, date of last

X4-10 TARGET MARKETING MENU [=]

X4.10-5 Customer Equipment Report
This job produces a listing of the units owned by selected
customers. Each unit's number, make, model, year, serial
number, and purchase date are included in the report.
Customers and units included in the report can be selected
according to a wide range of values.

X4.10-6 Marketing Sales Code Assignment
This job enables you to control which transactions from
Point of Sale and Unit Sales Entry are available to Target
Marketing.

Target Marketing is essentially comprised of three parts.

The first, Marketing Sales Code Assignment (X4.10-6), allows you to
set up which transactions are automatically carried into your Target
Marketing records. Point of Sale (X5-1) and Unit Sales Entry (X22-1)
copy transactions into a file that is used by Target Marketing. You decide
what kind of transactions will be available to Target Marketing by
assigning sales codes (for Point of Sale transactions) and function codes
(for Unit Sales Entry transactions) in Marketing Sales Code Assignment.
Note that this job does work retroactively; if you add a new sales code
today, yesterday's transactions that have that sales code will be available
to Target Marketing.

Target Marketing (the job) is really the workhouse of Target Marketing
(the menu). With this job you can view or modify all of your target
marketing information for any customer. Information such as address,
name, and phone are always displayed on the top of the screen. The
bottom half of the screen can be set to one of four individual modes.

The Customer Information Screen includes contacts, sales reps for
the customer, and the sales history of the customer. Additional

MARKETING


/ LJ X4-10 TARGET MARKETING MENU

fields detail information such as the customer's satisfaction with
your dealership and that customer's interest level. An individual
notebook page is available for this screen for every customer in

your records.

The Call Information Screen is actually a group of related screens,
specifically a group of calls. For the purposes of this screen, a call
represents any single attempt to contact the customer (i.e. by
phone, personally, mailer, etc.) Each call has fields detailing the
interest of the customer, the probability of purchase, call date and
time, call topic, and call method. As the customer is contacted,
individual calls are added or removed from this screen. An
individual notebook page is available for this screen for every
customer in your records.

The Equipment Information Screen, like the Call Information
Screen, can include multiple items. Each unit has its own screen
detailing information such as unit number, type, make, model,
serial number, and year. Additional fields indicate the unit's
condition, the unit's worth, and the unit's seller. An individual
notebook page is available for this screen for every customer in
your records.

The Transaction Screen, like the Call Information Screen, can
include multiple items. Each invoice has its own screen detailing
information such as invoice number, invoice type, amount,
description, and sales representative ID. An individual notebook
page is also available for this screen for every customer in your
records.

The last part of Target Marketing are the four report generators. Each


X4-10 TARGET MARKETING MENU [=]

report has its own emphasis and allows you to select specific customers on
it. Customer Equipment Report, for example, allows you to create a list of
customers who own a specific piece of equipment.

DIS BUSINESS SYSTEM SETUP

### Introduction

The DIS Business System Setup can perform the following tasks:

Reload the DIS Library

Load a fresh copy of the Query dictionary

Convert a new file set, such as a newly acquired dealership
Load an auxiliary PTF (Apply Enhancements could be used as
well)

= Load the sample company files (Z-files)

The setup option can do all this without much help from you. It is so
self-sufficient that it comes with an Express setup. For more complicated
and unusual situations, there is a Custom setup.

Note: Screen illustrations in this chapter apply to Release 1.4. Screens will
be slightly different for each release.

### How To Run

A dedicated system is not required for the following steps.

O Sign on as QSECOFR.

 

 

 

From the Security and Configuration Menu (X6), take option 11, DIS
Business System Setup. Pass through the security gate. The following
screen appears.


X6-11 DIS BUSINESS SYSTEM SETUP c

DIS BUSINESS SYSTEM SETUP
Welcome to the DIS Business System Setup program.

This program allows you to install all or some of the components
which make up the AS/400 V9L0/1.4 DIS Business System.

You will be prompted to make a decision regarding each aspect of the
installation. In most cases, the system will choose the correct

option for you. If you change your mind about one of the questions,
press Cmd3 to step backwards through the setup screens.

Press Enter to continue.

### Dis Business System Setup Setup-002

Two options are available for DIS Business System Setup.

Express Setup During express setup, the system will automatically
make most of the 1.@ setup decisions for you. After
the system has made its recommendations, you will be
presented with 2 list of setup tasks to be performed.
This option is ideal for a routine upgrade from an
earlier version of the system.

Custom Setup During custom setup, the system will present a series
of questions in order for you to customize which
modules will be affected by the 1.4 setup programs.
Use this option if you desire greater control over
the setup process

1. Express setup
2. Custom setup

Enter setup option: 2

 

Enter-Continue Cmdl-Cancel setup

 

Select the method you want to use. DIS recommends the Express setup,
which requires fewer decisions on your part.

What happens next depends on the type of setup you choose and the
version of the DIS Library and file set(s) on your disk. If you choose
Express, the setup makes decisions for you and displays the list of
proposed tasks. All complete file sets will be scheduled for conversion.
Replacement sample company files (Z-files) will be loaded. You will be
prompted only if the program needs information that pertained to a
previous version, such as a tax code to replace a blank tax code, which is

Load QRY1.4 data dictionary

If you have a catalog of files on your disk, look at the Q section for aQRY
entry. Or, maybe you know that your dealership uses Query to create
reports. The Query dictionary is small, and it can be deleted later. If you're
unsure and disk space is not a problem, go ahead and load it.

Reload Z files
The Z-files are for a sample company. Some dealers don't use the Z-files at
all; others depend on them and enter their own data to experiment with.

The setup program will put loading or reloading Z-files on the task list. If
there were no existing files, you may go back and choose not to load them.
If Z-files were found, you may go back and decide to do one of the
following:

1) Delete the files and restore a fresh set

2) Convert the existing files to 1.4
3) Ignore the files. If you do so, they will not function properly with 1.4.

Disk Space Analysis

 

You are encouraged to proceed with the disk space analysis at this time.
The system analyzes your current disk usage and estimates what you'll
need for Release 1.4 features. The goal is to keep disk usage under 85%.
The feature in the new release that uses the most disk space is Part Sales
History. The next screen will let you know that one of the following
conditions has been found:

features. You can press Cmd3-Back to remove tasks, such as the Query

POINT OF SALE SECURITY

### Introduction

Point of Sale Security is installed through the DIS OPT Library (Point of
Sale Menu 7, option 4). It is used to set up User IDs and passwords that
control what the user is allowed to do on a Point of Sale document. A
report, which can be used without POS Security, is printed at Parts End of
Day. Controlled functions are:

= Reopening documents
= Cancelling documents
= Using all sales codes

The first option within Point of Sale Security, Users Maintenance,
provides for the setup of User IDs and passwords and specifies which of
the controlled functions are allowed.

Users who are not allowed to use all sales codes can be restricted to
specified sales codes. See "Sales Codes By User Maintenance."

User IDs are required on the Point of Sale "Sold To" screen, which is
illustrated below. The User ID and Password are required to gain access to

Download (X38-8).

X6.15-2 Backup Electronic Commerce Configuration Files

Use this option to back up your Electronic Commerce configuration files. DIS
Electronic Commerce Manager 400 runs in Library DISFILES, so it doesn’t
interfere with DIS Backup. Since the configuration is not included in DIS Backup,
this option is used for backing the configuration up to tape.

 

### Warning

Make sure the correct tape is in the drive. There is no selection screen. The
system initializes the tape and proceeds to back up the EC files immediately.

X6.15-3 Restore Electronic Commerce Configuration Files

Use this option to restore your Electronic Commerce configuration files in case of
emergency.

SECTION 1 POINT OF SALE INVOICING

Point of Sale Invoicing provides for:

Counter Tickets
Priority Orders
Rental/Leasing
Service Management
Work Orders

Because of the size and complexity of Point of Sale Invoicing, this chapter
is divided into 3 sections. Section 1 covers Point of Sale screens and its
basic features. Section 2 covers the multitude of advanced features that are
available within Point of Sale, including electronic parts catalogs. Section
3 covers Service Management, which can be purchased separately.

Unlike they are in other jobs, the command key options are not always
listed at the bottom of Point of Sale screens; however, you can press the
[Help] key ([Alt]+[F1] in Client Access) to see what command keys are
available. The command keys are described in the discussion of the Sold

52-3, SALES CODE MAINTENANCE.

Changing a Line
Before the various formats are discussed, it is important to know what to

do if you want to change a line that has already been placed on a
document. Look closely at the line illustrated below.

If you want to change the position of the line on the document, use the
2- digit field immediately to the left of the line number. By entering
numbers 01-99 in this field, you can control the order in which lines
appear on the invoice. Normally, lines are grouped by sales code;
however, numbers in this "invisible" field take precedence over sales
codes.

Note:
On a new line, you can assign a line number that will place a line where
you want it within a sales code group, such as 0065 to follow line 0060.
This technique doesn't work on an existing line unless you want to delete
it and start over.

### Parts Search Window

Evoke the Parts Window by putting a "?" in the "Part Number" field on
the detail screen. You may perform a positional search by part number by
entering a text string after the "?”. Besides the fact that the text string
begins with a "2" the resulting search would be equivalent to a search by
part number detailed below.

Once the Parts Search Window is displayed, you can perform a search by
part number by entering a text string and press [Enter]. You will be
positioned in the Parts Index to the first part that begins with text string
you just entered (positional search). Alternately, if you precede the text
string with a "*" the computer will display all parts that contain the text
string you entered in any position (non-positional search). For example
"*10" would find 10551, 911002, and, 6510.

You may also perform a search by description. This works in the same
way as the parts search, except that [Cmd5] and not [Enter] is pressed
once the text string has been keyed in.

parts, unit sales, etc. Only parts in inventory are listed. (See also, Work Order List

### Cmd12-Part Availability

A REAL TIME SAVER, especially for work orders and quotes, the Part
Availability screen makes it possible to check the availability of a lot of parts very
quickly and transfer them directly to a Point of Sale document. You can reach the
Part Availability screen from an open document or directly from the Point of Sale
Entrance screen. You can even open a new document from Part Availability,
eliminating the need to return to the entrance screen or to rekey the parts.

The Part Availability screen accommodates 10 part numbers, which may be
regularly stocked parts that are in your inventory files, parts that are in a price
book, or brand new part numbers. Parts that are located in a price book and brand
new part numbers can be added to the sales document and to your inventory files
from Part Availability. Supersession is checked even if master information on the
part is not provided by the manufacturer. See also, Adding Parts from Point of
Sale.

The parts search window is available from Part Availability by typing a question
mark (?) in the part number field. Bearing Interchange information is available by
typing a pound sign (#) in the part number field. See Parts Search Window.

[Cmd12] From an Open Document f

Part Availability provides an easy way to enter parts, especially on work orders.
It's much faster to open the document first. Although it is possible go to the Part
Availability screen from the Sold To screen, it is not recommended. To use Part
Availability most efficiently, follow the steps listed below:

O Provide the information required on the Sold To screen, and press [Enter] to go
to the detail screen.

0 On the detail line, use a sales code with the parts format.

0) Make sure the tax and discount codes are correct.

D0 Type the vendor code and the first part number.

O Press [Cmd12]. The Part Availability screen appears. On it you'll see the
relevant information from the current document. Also, because the detail line
was completed, the default vendor, tax and discount codes, and base price
code are already established.

[Cmd12] From the Entrance Screen

Part Availability is often used to make quick quotes or to check availability in
response to a customer's phone call.

O From the Point of Sale Entrance screen, press [Cmd12]. The Part Availability
screen appears. Since there was no open document, the only information you'll
see is the default vendor, which is set up in Security Maintenance (X6-6).

0 Fumish the default vendor code on line 3, then proceed to check parts as

described in the section above, "From the Detail Screen."
Checking Availability

O Type up to 10 part numbers and the quantities required, pressing [Field Exit] to
go to the next field. Type the vendor code only when it is different from the
default.

O Press [Enter] to check availability. The system checks your inventory files and
the price book, if any. In the column labeled "Comments," you'll see one of

the following:

OK Part is stocked and available.


NOT OK

NOT OK/PRC BK

X$-1 ¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING 31

If the part number is valid (check the description
field), it is stocked but unavailable. If the system
could not locate the part at all, it displays
"INVALID PART" in the description and indents
the part number one space to the right, which
prevents your adding bogus part numbers to your
files.

If it really is a valid number and you want to add it,
you can delete the space and make it line up with
the other parts before you press [Cmd5]. To
eliminate invalid part numbers from the current
screen, leave the indentation and press [Enter].

If the part number is available in another division,
the quantity and the division are listed immediately
after the "NOT OK" message. Its bin location is in
the division where it is available. See the section,
TRANSFERRING PARTS.

Part is not stocked but was located in a price book.

O If you need to open a document at this point, see "Opening a Document,”

which follows.

O To remove parts, field exit through the quantity.

O To add parts to the Point of Sale document, press [Cmd5]. The dollar totals are
updated and parts are added as follows:

OK
NOT OK

NOT OK/PRC BK

Added to the document as is.

Valid part numbers are added with a “P” in the
column labeled "TDP," which means that they will
be added to the priority order queue when the
document is held or closed.

Invalid part numbers are not added unless you
correct the indentation. The part number is then
added to the document with a “P" order code, as
described above. The part number is added to your
inventory files as 1 segment, left justified, with no
further information. These parts appear on the Parts
End of Day Parts Segmentation Error report and
must be corrected in Parts Posting & Maintenance
(X3-2) as soon as possible; otherwise, they will
cause problems with parts jobs that require proper
segmentation.

Parts are added to the document with a “P" order

files as 1 segment, left justified, along with

O Repeat for other parts or press one of the command keys listed at the bottom of

the screen.

SECTION 2 POINT OF SALE: ADVANCED FEATURES

Adding Parts From Point of Sale

When a customer needs a part that you don't stock, you can add the part number
to a Point of Sale document, to your inventory files, and place it in the priority
order queue, all at the same time. The procedure depends on whether you are
adding from the detail screen or from the Part Availability screen and whether
you are adding from a price book or not.

Detail Screen With a Price Book

To add a part to a document and to your inventory files from a price book, follow
these steps.

On the parts format detail line, type the part number and press [Enter]. If the
part is located in a price book, the message, "Part found in price book," is
displayed. The system places a "P" in the field labeled "Pty" (Priority), which
means that the part will be placed in the priority order queue. For more
information, see the section on Priority Orders, which is presented later.

O Press [Enter] again to add the part to the document. Information about parts
located in a price book, is added to the document and to your parts inventory
files. The part is added as 1 segment, left justified.

O Check the "Add Parts Segmentation" report at Parts End of Day, and correct
the segmentation in Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2). It is important to
make these corrections daily; otherwise, these parts may cause errors in other
parts jobs that depend on proper segmentation.

Without a Price Book

To add a part to a document and to your inventory files without a price book,
follow these steps.

O On the parts format detail line, type the part number with its segment markers.
The segmentation must conform to what is set up for the vendor in
Vendor/Class Configuration (X38- 1). It may help to look at a Configuration
Report (X38-2). For more information about segmentation, see CHAPTER
X3-2, PARTS POSTING & MAINTENANCE.

### Point Of Sale X5-1 « Point Of Sale Invoicing 35

O Press [Enter]. The system places a "P" in the field labeled "Pty" (Priority),
which means that the part will be placed in the priority order queue. For more
information, see the section on Priority Orders, which is presented later.

O Since no prices are available, you must type the sales price and press [Field
Exit].

O Press [Enter] again to add the part to the document and to your parts inventory
files. The price you type on the detail line is not added to the part record. As
soon as possible, add information about the part in Parts Posting &
Maintenance (X3-2). Until you add prices to the master record, the system
uses the percentage factor for the sales account to figure cost.

Part Availability Screen - [Cmd12]

When the system encounters a part that is not in inventory but is in a price book,
the message, "NOT OK/PRC BOOK." is displayed on the same line as the part
number, in the column labeled "Price Comments."

When the system encounters a part that is not in inventory and not in a price book,
you'll see "NOT OK" in the column labeled "Comments" and "INVALID PART"
in the description. Further, the part number is indented one space to prevent your
adding bogus part numbers inadvertently. Make sure the part number is valid,
then move your cursor to the left of the part number and press [Del] (Delete) to
move the part number one space to the left, in line with other part numbers on the
screen.

O To add the part, along with other parts on the screen, to the P.O.S. document,
press [{Cmd5]. The part is added to inventory, left justified, with 1 segment.
On the decument, the part appears with a “P" in the column labeled "TDP,"
which indicates that the part will be added to the priority order queue.

If the part was found in a price book, information about the part, such as
description, prices, and supersession information, is added to the document and
to your parts inventory files.

If the part was not added from a price book, you'll need to add the price by
bringing the line down before you close the document (see Changing a Line).
The other information should be added as soon as possible in Parts Posting &
Maintenance (X3- 2). Until you add prices to the master record, the system
uses the percentage factor for the sales account to figure cost.

O Check the “Add Parts Segmentation" report at Parts End of Day, and correct
the segmentation in Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2). It is important to


36 X5-1 » POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

make these corrections daily; otherwise, these parts may cause errors in other
parts jobs that depend on proper segmentation.

### Company Vehicles

Expenses on company-owned vehicles can be tracked easily by handling them
like customers rather than units.

O In Receivables Maintenance (X11-2), set up an address number for the vehicle.

Suggestion: use the license plate number, or "VEH" plus 3 characters of the
serial number.

O If you want the vehicles to be displayed together in the customer index, use the
same prefix on the "Name" field. Examples: VEHICLE-BLUE DODGE
REPAIR VAN or VEHICLE-EL CAMINO or VEHICLE-BOB'S TRUCK.

O For the general ledger account number, use the appropriate expense account.
You'll receive a message reminding you that the account does not have an "A"
edit code: just press [Enter] to continue.

0 In Point of Sale Invoicing, open the document to the vehicle just as you would
to any other customer, and proceed as usual.

and availability checks are in force.

Templates

The Copy-Lines function plus a little creativity on your part will enhance
productivity enormously. You can create templates (quotes) for all sorts of things:
kits, standard jobs, winter tune-ups, paint jobs, oil changes, or any combination of
parts and labor that are usually sold together. Remember, quotes will not have any
effect on your inventory.

You could set up a "fake" customer (or unit) where the quotes are held. As the
quotes are established, you can use the P.O.# field on the Sold-To screen to enter
a short description, which will be displayed at the document index at Point of
Sale.

As an extra shortcut, use the Letter Writer (X4-5) to establish a list of the
documents and tape the letter where it will be accessible to Point of Sale users or
print copies of the quotes and organize them in a notebook.

The Copy-Lines process can be used to copy as many templates (source
documents) as you want into the same target document.

CREDIT CARDS C

Introduction

DIS has developed software that accommodates all types of credit cards at Point
of Sale Invoicing. Transactions can be electronically transmitted to First Data
Resources (FDR) in Omaha, Nebraska, which is a clearinghouse that processes
credit applications, authorizes and processes transactions, and bills customers
monthly. To accomplish the electronic transfer, a DataTran device, which requires
an additional COM port, is used. If you are interested in purchasing a DataTran
device, contact your DIS Marketing Representative.

FDR assigns Merchant Ids and authorizes dealerships to submit transactions for
the credit cards they plan to accept. In addition to major credit cards, FDR handles
private-label credit cards, such as Case Credit and New Holland, which are
handled like any other credit card. The dealership receives a remittance for the
amount of the transaction, less the discount, within 48 hours.

On the Sold To screen at Point of Sale Invoicing, a “Credit Card" field will be

displayed when a document is opened to a receivable customer. It is available for (
charge and cash documents and will not be visible on internal documents, quotes,
standard jobs, or history documents. When a credit card code is present and the
document is closed, the Credit Card Authorization screen is displayed. In this

chapter, you'll learn how to enter the credit card type and how to use the

authorization screens, which are different for electronic and manual authorization.

You'll learn how to charge a portion of the total and accept cash for the rest.

 

 

 

NOTE:
For credit cards that have been set up with FDR, transactions can be pre-
authorized. To do so, it is necessary to press F2=Close and Print to reach

the authorization screen; however, when a pre-authorization is requested,
the document is not closed. After the pre-authorization is complete, you'll
be returned to the document detail screen and the document can then be
held.

 

If the DataTran device is powered off, it must be reset or the background job must
be canceled.


POINT OF SALE X5-1 » POINT OF SALE INVOICING 43

### Warning!

If there is a problem with electronic authorization and your terminal locks
up, wait for the program to time out (about 3 minutes); otherwise, your files
may lock up. Do not do a System Request to terminate the job.

 

Setup Overview

All credit card sales, including private cards, require the same setup. Here are the
steps:

1) Account Maintenance (X14-2). Decide on a general ledger account for the
card.

2) Receivables Maintenance (X11-2). Create a receivables address number for
the card.

3) Credit Card Maintenance (X52-14). Set up a code and description for the
card and enter its receivables address number. If you don't have a DataTran
device or if the card has not been set up with FDR for electronic transmission, set
EDC Capable=N.

4) Receivables Maintenance (X11-2). Optional. Enter credit card information for
each customer and select a default to be used at Point of Sale Invoicing.

5) Credit Code Maintenance (X68-1). Optional. Set up a credit code to flash a
message at Point of Sale alerting salespeople that a customer needs to fill out a
credit card application.

In addition, two other setup options are required for a DataTran device:

6). EDC Configuration (X52-15) and Installation of the DataTran Device.
Configuration is an option on the Table Maintenance Menu. You'll use it to set up
merchant Ids assigned by FDR, establish a cutoff time for transaction batches, and
change or add promotion codes and specify a default promotion code. An
installation diagram is at the end of the chapter.

Error Recovery. For your convenience, error recovery procedures related to the
DataTran device can be found at the end of this chapter and in EDC Configuration
(52-15).

What You Need to Know About Credit Card Transaction Batches

When you are using a DataTran device, there are 3 distinct batches of credit card
transactions, which may or may not contain the same individual transactions:

1) On the DIS system, the Point of Sale posting batch includes credit card
transactions,


44 X5-1 # POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

2) On the DIS system, the FDR batch includes credit card transactions that have ‘a °
been transmitted to FDR.

3) On the FDR system, there is a batch of credit card transactions that have been

received and are settled at 6:00 P.M. Central time.

As credit card transactions are automatically authorized and transmitted using the
DataTran device, they are listed in an open FDR batch on the Baich List screen in
Transmit Credit Card Transactions (X55-5). This is not the same as the Point of
Sale batch: it contains only credit card transactions that have been closed and
transmitted to FDR. There is a similar batch at FDR. The FDR batch is
automatically settled by FDR at 6:00 P.M. Central Time. The time that batches
are cut off on the DIS system (settle time) should be set to coincide with FDR's
settlement. Settle time is entered from the Merchant ID maintenance window in
EDC Configuration (F14 from X52-15).

If there have been manually authorized transactions, you'll use Transmit Credit
Card Transactions (X55-5), to send them to FDR and make them a part of the
current FDR batch.

Also, you can use option X55-5 to display and print batches, and move a

transaction to a different batch when you're reconciling your statement from FDR.

A transaction could end up in different batches on the FDR and DIS systems if the

DIS system clock is slightly different from the one at FDR. In addition, if a batch

is ever out of balance, which is unlikely, it can be recalculated using option X55- (
4.

Active Background Job

Transmitting credit card sales with a DataTran device adds an active job that runs
24-hours a day. It is started for the first time by going into Point of Sale. The only
time you need to be concerned about stopping it is to reset the DataTran device,
which is explained in this chapter. It can be seen by typing: WRKACTJOB
[Enter] at a command line. Look for a job that begins "DISD" followed by the
name of the DataTran device, such as DT1 in the example below:

Opt Subsystem/Job User Type CPU % Function Status
DISDDTL asys SBS 0 D=EQW

4. DISDDTL DUANEP BCH -0  PGM-DATRANCL DEQW

 

Point of Sale Posting Batch

The DIS Point of Sale posting batch will include all closed credit card

transactions at the time it is created. Transactions for cards that are not EDC

Capable are handled the same as those that are processed by FDR. If it is created

at the same time the FDR batch is cut off, the two batches will be most similar. L


POINT OF SALE : XS-1 POINT OF SALE INVOICING 45

The Point of Sale batch will include both automatically and manually authorized
transactions.

Charges to the customer's account are automatically reversed in the posting batch
and charged to the credit card receivable. Charges to the customer's account are
identified by the characters "$C" in the last 2 positions of the description field.

Example:

   

700164 #* D A1110 43.11 COUNTER TISc 000001 Carolyan Ca:
7 CTOOLEd $+ C AZ700 12 COUNTER TICK

7 CTOOIEE H* C A330 39 000001 Carolynn ca:

      

Automatic transactions, identified by AUTO, are generated to reverse the debit
to the customer's account. On the debit to the customer's account, the original
document number is placed in the document number and description fields. On
the debit to the credit card account, the original document number is placed in the
document number field. The customer's address is placed in the description field
with the 2-character code for the credit card, such as CC, FP, MC, VI, etc., in the
last 2 positions (CC in the example below).

Example:

OD To accept a deposit from a charge customer at Point of Sale, open the
document to CUSTD. Put the real customer's name in both the "PO#" and
"Ship To" fields. Use the sales code DI (Deposit IN). There will be an error in
the P.O.S. batch asking for a due date on the line crediting D2430. Add it. Be

key. This makes the amount negative. The deposit will be subtracted from
anything else added to the document. There will be an error in the P.O.S.
batch on the line debiting D2430. To correct the line, put the customer's name

O Merge the debit and credit lines for the vendor CUSTD in Correct Due Dates
and Discounts (X12-7). If the deposit is to be refunded to the customer, Print
Payables Checks (X12- 8) can be run on vendor CUSTD.

### Dropship Orders

A dropship order is a special case of a priority order. Priority orders are discussed
in a separate section, which you may want to review if you need more

 

information.

Note:
The order number for a dropship is the same as its Point of Sale document
number.

 

 

A dropship order is opened to the customer as usual. On the Sold To screen, enter
the appropriate information in the area labeled "Ship To."

A priority order that is shipped directly from the manufacturer or vendor to the
customer is a "dropship." Only inventoried parts can be handled by the dropship
process; that is, a part that has a part number in your inventory files, whether you
regularly stock the part or not. Dropship parts are placed on Point of Sale
documents by using a detail line with a parts format, and by placing a “D"
(Dropship) in the field labeled “Pty.”

### Electronic Parts Catalogs

The DIS Seamless Interface provides easy Windows access to data in the DIS
Business System and electronic parts catalogs. The interface is the software that
enables you to use inforrhation from your inventory files and from an electronic
parts catalog (EPC) at the same time.

Part information from the catalog, such as the description, is displayed along with
information from your files, such as pricing, bin location, and on hand quantity, if
the part is already in inventory.

You can tell where the part was located by looking at the bin location. If the part
is in your inventory, its actual bin location is displayed. If the part is located in the
price book, the name of the price book appears in brackets in the bin location
field, such as [NH]. If the part is located in the electronic parts catalog, you'll see
[EPC] in the bin location. Pricing is either from your parts files or based on
Vendor/Class Configuration

(X38-1).

The interface provides:

" A part list, which may be transferred to the Point of Sale detail screen using
Cmd24-Part Lists. After a part list is selected, it is copied to the invoice or
work order using the preview method (one line at a time) of Copy Lines. This
feature is always available. The parts list is called a "Transaction List" or
TLIST in the New Holland/Partsmart systems or a “pick list" in the Agco and
Case systems.

« If the Part Availability feature is configured, the interface transfers a
transaction list to Part Availability automatically when the TLIST is closed.
Up to 10 parts are transferred to the Part Availability screen. After 1 or more

### Labor Costing C

This feature allows you to record the exact cost associated with sales of labor at
Point of Sale. The expense associated with the cost of labor can be reflected in the
cost of sale account.

For actual costing, the system multiplies the rate of pay for an employee by the
hours reported for the labor. The result is debited to the labor cost of sale account
with the labor sales.

The key to labor costing is a valid pay rate and valid wage code. To set up actual
labor costing, follow the procedure below.

 

Note:
Do not set up sublet labor sales accounts in this way. Costing will be done by
manual entry when the bill from the vendor is received.

 

shop. The address number identifies the employee for payroll and as the
mechanic performing the labor at Point of Sale. A pay rate is tied to the (
employee along with a wage code. The hours reported per job by the
employee will be multiplied by the pay rate for the employee. This will be the
amount of costing posted to the labor cost of sale general ledger account.
C1 In General Ledger Account Maintenance, set up sales accounts for labor as
described below. They must be set up for actual costing. Each labor sales
account must have its own unique cost of sale account.

### Miscellaneous Expenses

In this section, you'll learn how to handle several common situations from Point
of Sale, making it easy to balance the till at the end of the day and track
everything from CODs to vending machine expenses. The discussion of "Vehicle
Mileage” provides a slick way to "trick" the system into keeping records on your
company vehicles.

coD

COD customers don't usually have charge accounts; therefore, this single address

tracks all sales that are Cash On Delivery.

C1 In Receivables Maintenance (X 11-2), set up an address of COD. Establish the
COD address as open-item (type "O"). Use the receivables general ledger
account. For Credit Code (1), enter "N" for no interest.

O At Point of Sale, open the document to the address, COD. Type the customer's
name in the "P.O.#" field, which is displayed in the document index and
corresponds to the description field in Create Source Documents.

CO On the Point of Sale detail screen, parts will be placed with a "P" in the "Pty"
(Priority) field. See PRIORITY ORDERS later in this chapter or CHAPTER
X5-3.


X5-1 « POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

Paidouts: Cokes, UPS, FEDX, Greyhound, etc.

To handle various expenses that come up every day or so, such as COKES, UPS,
etc., you can set up system addresses and assign the corresponding general ledger
expense accounts to them. Follow the steps below:

O In Receivables Maintenance (X11-2), set up customer address numbers for the
expense accounts involved in daily cash transactions. Assign the appropriate
general ledger accounts to them. Make them balance forward (type=B). Make
sure the "Credit Code (1)" field is set to "N" (no interest).

C1 In Sales Code Maintenance, set up a Sales Code (X52-3) which debits *AUTO
and credits the Cash on Hand general ledger account number. Using this sales
code will help to keep the till balanced and track the day's paidouts.

0 At Point of Sale, open the document to the customer, such as COKES. Use the
sales code established in the previous step. The COKES expense account is
debited, Cash on Hand is credited.

Shop Expenses

Very often, expense accounts need to be charged for items sold to various
departments through Point of Sale. For example, the shop may buy parts from the
parts department. If the parts department receives commission on parts sales,
tracking the sale of the parts may be important. The parts department should be
credited for the sale of the parts, and the shop should be charged the expense of
the parts.

This is easy to handle at Point of Sale. Let's follow the above example through the

Point of Sale system by treating the shop the same as any other customer.

O In Receivables Maintenance (X11-2), set up a customer address, such as
SHOP. Use the expense account that is debited when the shop uses parts.
Make the SHOP a balance forward customer (type=B). Make sure "Credit
Code (1}" is "N" (no interest).

O At Point of Sale, open the document to the customer SHOP and proceed as
usual. When the document is posted, the expense account is debited and the
appropriate sales account is credited.

Small Cash Sales

This method was devised for a dealership that didn't want to open a separate
document for every nut and bolt sold for cash. It uses the cash address, CASHd
(_ =a space and d = division code).

Each day at Point of Sale, open a document to _CASH4d. Place on the document
any sales where the customer does not require a receipt. Close the document
before the Point of Sale batch is created. Give the copy of the document to the
accounting department to help balance the till.

L:


POINT OF SALE X5-1 » POINT OF SALE INVOICING 73

Vehicle Mileage

The following is an example of how to keep track of miles on vehicles. Say you
have a truck that is used to haul customer equipment into the dealership to be
worked on.

O Set up a general ledger account for this purpose. It really does not matter what
general ledger number is assigned as the account will never have a balance.
Use a P edit code on the account.

Account: D2370

Title: Mileage Tracking
Edit Code: P

Debit Code: M

Account 1: Cash account
Account 2: Discounts account
Factor:

Type: L

O Set up the company truck in Employee Maintenance (X1-3). For example set
up TRUCK as the Employee address number for the truck used for general
purposes.

O Set up the trucks as Vendors. In Vendor Maintenance, set up TRUCK as the
Vendor Number. On the Vendor Maintenance screen, enter the general ledger
number of the account created in step 1 in the Vendor acct # field.

O On the Point of Sale Document, use the Sales code for Labor. The tax and
discount code being used for the customer are fine. Again, it will not be
critical. In the Employee # field, enter the Employee address number created
in step 2.

C1 In the "Date of Work" field, enter the date to be used for any Federal Reports
required, Leave the Hours Report field blank.

O Enter the mileage with 2 decimal places in the Hours Billed field. Enter 546.4
miles as 54640. Press [Field Exit].

Cl In the Rate field, enter 00 (zeros) and press [Field Exit]. Press {Enter] to add
the line to the document.

O When the document is printed and closed, the labor (mileage) will be printed
on the Office Copy. Give the Office Copy to the accountant.

O The mileage should be posted in Create Source documents (X1-7). Post it like
this:

 

Dec# Acct# Amount Description Addr# Date Discount  Stock#
Milge c D2370 00 TRUCK MILGE TRUCK 123186 54640

O Run a Vendor Inquiry (X12-1) with printout on TRUCK to get the total
mileage for the year. The mileage will be listed in the Discount column on the
printout.

O At the end of the year, run the Print Payables Checks (X12-8) on the Vendor
TRUCK. It will clear the vendor out for next year.

### Price Book C~

Tf you have 5 or fewer price books loaded, Point of Sale uses ali of them
automatically. If you happen to have more than 5, you can select any 5 from the
Price Book Selection screen, which follows the print options screen.

Parts in a price book can be added to your inventory files from the detail screen
and from the Part Availability screen. This process is described in the section,
Adding Parts at Point of Sale.

You can review a price book by using Display Price Book from Additional
Options Menu, which is reached by pressing [Cmdi1] from Point of Sale. See
also CHAPTER X37-3, DISPLAY/PRINT PRICE BOOK.


POINT OF SALE X5-1 POINT OF SALE INVOICING 75

 

### Priority Orders

The discussion in this section provides only a brief overview. Priority orders are
covered in detail in CHAPTER X5-3, PRIORITY ORDERS. Also, CHAPTER
X3-3, PARTS INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT MENU, provides a lot of
information about the basic assumptions underlying the DIS Business System and
its handling of parts inventory. Dropship sales, which are a special case of Priority
Orders, are discussed in a separate section of Section 2 — see Dropship Orders.

The DIS Business System tracks priority (emergency) orders with maximum
efficiency. By taking time to understand how they are handled, you can eliminate
a lot of list- keeping and notes to yourself about who needs what. You can also
save money by shifting parts from priority orders to stock orders whenever you
can.

When you enter a part number on a parts detail line (format=P), the system checks
the quantity that is available for sale. The available quantity is different from the
on hand quantity. For example, there may be 3 parts on hand, but 2 of them may
be reserved for other Point of Sale documents; therefore, only 1 is available.

When a customer needs a part that is not available or not normally stocked (not in
your inventory files), the system redisplays the detail line and places a "P" in the
field labeled "Pty." The line is not placed on the document until you press [Enter]
a second time, which provides an opportunity for you to decide how to handle the
situation.

Valid Order Codes

You may, of course, accept the line by pressing [Enter], or you may want to
replace the "P" with any valid order code from the list following:

D= Dropship

L=Lost sale

P = Priority order

Q=Rob a prior reservation and order the part

R = Rob a prior reservation and do not order

S = Place the part on a stock order

On the document, the order code appears in the column on the left, which is
labeled "TDP" (Tax, Discount, Priority).

Clone Documents

The part is placed in the order queue as soon as the document is closed or placed
on hold. If the document is closed, a clone document is created. Clone documents
are easy to spot because their number is the same as the original document with
an alphabetical character at the end. For example, a counter ticket CTO0805 is


76 X5-1 ¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

cloned to CTOO805A. If CTOO805A is closed before all orders have been filled, it { ~~
is cloned to CTOO80SB, etc.

Order Numbers

After the priority order is finalized in Priority Orders (X5-3), or the stock order is
finalized in Print/Finalize Order (X34-3), the order code(s) are changed. After the
order that contains the part has been received in Receive Order (X342-2), the code
is changed to “a,” which means that the part is available for sale. The table below
summarizes the progression of the codes as they appear on Point of Sale
documents:

ORIGINAL ORDERED RECEIVED (Available)
P Pp a
s s a

The default order number for priority orders, MMDDYYnd, is assigned on the
last screen of Priority Orders (X5-3), where it can be changed.
MMDDY Y=Current date.
n=sequence number, 0-9.
d=your division code.
Parts that appear on Point of Sale documents with an "S" order code are
automatically placed on stock order POSd (d=your division code). You can use
Move Order Lines (X34-6) to move the lines to a system-generated or manual (
stock order.

Partially Filled Order

Point of Sale documents that include parts that have been ordered can be
processed before all parts have been received. Two examples follow.

© A customer enters the dealership. He asks for two nuts, 6 bolts, 2 cans of oil,
and 2 tires. You had the 2 tires, but the other parts had to be ordered. The
document number was CT00356. The nuts have come in, but the oil and bolts

have not.

When the document was closed, a clone document, was created. The clone
document number is CT00356A. The customer wants the nuts now. You can
retrieve the clone document, CT00356A. When looking at CTO0356A, an "a"
will display by the nuts part number. This indicates that the order has been
received, and the document can be closed. The customer will be billed for the

nuts.

Anew clone document is created, CT00356B. Each time the document is
closed, a new clone will be created until the whole order is filled.


POINT OF SALE X5-1 » POINT OF SALE INVOICING 77

1 If a customer needs 5 screws that are priority ordered, and 3 come in, you can
sel] them without waiting for the other 2. When the document is retrieved, the
small "p" will still be displayed on the document. The little "a" will not
display until the entire order for the part is received.

O On the detail line, type the sales code that was used to sell the part originally.
On the same line, type the Tax code, discount (Disc) code, vendor, quantity of
the part to be sold now (in this case, 3), and the part number. Press [Enter].
The line will be redisplayed with a "P" in the "Pty" field. There are no parts
available for sale. The three parts on hand are reserved already.

U Change the large "P" to “R” to Rob the reservation and not place the part on
order. Press [Enter]. The line is added to the document.

(1 Bring down the line that displays the small “p." Change the quantity (Qty)
to the amount still on order. In this case the quantity would be changed to
2. Press [Enter]. The line is changed.

O Press [Cmd2] to print and close the document. A clone document is created
for the parts still on order.

QUANTITY BREAK PRICING Co

What is Quantity Break Pricing?

Many manufacturers receive quantity break pricing from their suppliers, price
breaks for buying in volume. The price depends upon the quantity. For example,
there may be one price if they buy from 1 to 9 of an item, and a lower price if they
buy 10 or more, and an even lower price if they buy 50 or more. There may be
several ranges with corresponding price decreases. Manufacturers may choose to
pass these savings on to the dealers. Dealers, in turn, may want to pass the savings
on to customers who buy in large quantities.

Advantages of Quantity Break Pricing

Selling parts in large volumes helps to reduce your costs. The parts do not have to
be counted or handled as often. Storage costs are decreased. Up front, the parts
may not cost as much because of the large quantity discounts received from the
manufacturer.

What is required
A price book with quantity break pricing is required. Quantity break pricing is
furnished by some manufacturers, usually on a separate price tape. (

Identifying the Customers

You can identify the customers who buy in volume on their master records in
Receivables Maintenance (X11-2). The default, which is "N," is automaticaily
displayed at Point of Sale where it can be changed.

Identifying the Parts

The price tape sent by the manufacturer will identify parts with quantity break
prices and the breaks offered on specific quantities (ranges). A "Y" appears on the
Parts Posting & Maintenance screen in the field labeled “Qty Break" during Price
Tape Update. [f you want a part to be considered for quantity break pricing at
Point of Sale, change this field to "N."

Quantity break pricing information is kept in the price book, not in your inventory
files. If the price book is removed, quantity break information will be lost.

At Point of Sale

On the Sold To screen, the field labeled "Quantity Break Pricing" displays "Y" or

"N" from the customer's master record (Receivables Maintenance, X11-2). You

can change the default, making Quantity Break Pricing available on a document- ‘oe


POINT OF SALE X5-1_¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING 79
OO EY SALE INVOICING 7D

by-document basis. Changing the default at Point of Sale has no effect on the
customer's master record; it does make it possible to offer special pricing ona
document-by-document basis.

After you press [Enter] to go to the detail screen, the system records your choice
for quantity break pricing (Y or N). If, after adding parts to the document, you
return to the Sold To screen, you can change from "Y" to "N" or vice versa. Parts
that are already on the document are not affected; however, parts added after the
change are priced accordingly. By changing the field on the Sold To screen at the
appropriate time, you can control quantity break pricing line-by-line if necessary.

Stocked Parts:

When Quantity Break Pricing=Y on the Sold To screen, parts sold on the detail
screen are checked in the price book to determine the range and price that applies.
The system calculates the extended price by muitiplying the quantity break price
by the quantity sold. If the parts are in stock and available, they are added to the
invoice. If a portion is unavailable, the line is redisplayed with a "P" in the field
labeled "Priority." To add the parts to the priority order queue and place them on
the document, where they show as "ORDERED," simply press [Enter].

When the parts are available, the quantity break ranges and prices are displayed
after the line is added to the invoice. Sometimes, buying one more part will lower
the price. If the customer wants to buy the additional part(s), bring the line down,
change the quantity, and press [Enter].

If there is more than one line already on the invoice with the same part number

and vendor code, a message, "Part# exists on document," is displayed. Combining

these lines will increase the quantity ordered, possibly raising the quantity break

range and Jowering the price. In this case, make a note of the quantities and add

them to find the total. Bring down each line, and delete all but the last one by

pressing [Cmd6]. On the last line, change the quantity to the total number actually

sold, press [Field Exit] and [Enter]. (

Non-Stocked Parts

When Quantity Break Pricing=Y on the Sold To screen and a part is sold on the

7 If the quantity does not fall into a Quantity Break Price range, normal pricing
is applied. However, the first two quantity break ranges and prices will still be
displayed. This can be used as a selling tool. The customer can view on screen
how much can be saved by purchasing one or two more parts.

### Point Of Sale X5-1 » Point Of Sale Invoicing 81

 

O If the price was manually entered in the Price field, the program will not check
the price ranges. A manually entered price overrides the Quantity Break Price
program.

1 When Quantity Break Pricing=Y on the Sold To screen, the message,
“Quantity Break Pricing specified but no price is price book,” is displayed on
the detail line for the following reasons:

a) No quantity break pricing exists for the part.

b) There are no quantity break pricing records in the Price book currently
selected.

¢) The price book is not loaded.

d) The part is from a different vendor.

O Lines that contain parts with Quantity Break Pricing records can be corrected
by changing only the quantity. The new price will be figured automatically.

Changes being made to existing lines with parts containing no Quantity Break
Records must be made another way. If you wish to sell a part at a base other than
4 (Dlr List), for example, bring the line down. Change the quantity if necessary,
field exit the price and change the base. If you do not field exit the price, it will
not be changed.

Audit Procedures

Your Parts End of Day reports provide important audit information that should be
checked on a regular basis. (Yes, you need to READ them!) Quantity Break
Pricing presents an unusual opportunity for unscrupulous employees to take
advantage of the system, but the evidence will appear in black and white on the
End of Day Audit Report. A typical case is described below.

If an invoice is opened with an "N” in the Quantity Break Pricing field, the parts
on the invoice will be priced as normal. Assume the customer pays cash for these
parts.

Later, if the invoice is reopened, the Quantity Break Pricing field could be
changed to "Y." The lines could be brought down and changed for quantity break
pricing and re-entered.

The total on this invoice, which will be included in the Point of Sale Batch, will
be different from the one given to the customer. At best, the cash drawer will be
over the difference. At worst, someone could have pocketed the difference.

To guard against this kind of error, the End of Day Audit Report should be
reviewed each day. The section to check is “Changes to Quantity." which is sorted
by vendor, then by part number.

### Point Of Sale Invoicing

Be on the lookout for part numbers that show several of the same invoice number.
In the report illustrated below, part number 015842 appears three times on the
report. This report shows the first sale of 4 parts at $111.50. The negative number
under the Total Change field indicates a sale. Next you see a return of 4 parts at
$111.50. The third transaction indicates a resale of 4 parts at $100.00. This is the
sort of transaction that merits investigation.

RENTAL/LEASING

A rental unit can be placed on any Point of Sale document by using a sales code
with a Miscellaneous Unit ("U") format.

Rental Status

Excellent management of rentals begins with keeping the rental status of each unit
current. You can change the rental status of a unit from Point of Sale by using a
Rental Status Flag (RSF) on a miscellancous unit sales code or by pressing
[Cmd15} to go directly to Point of Sale.

Rental Status Flag (RSF)
A miscellaneous unit sales code is illustrated below:

 

### Rental

I/w Line SC Unit# Description---~----~----------- RSF = Amount A
0010 MU UL0502 WITH ATTACHMENTS R 32500 Date out/in

060993 Mtr ocut/in 107898 Standard line

 

 

The Rental Status Flag may be one of the following:

Flag Result

R=Rented Rental status is changed from AV=Available to
RE=Rented. If the unit is already rented, an error
message lets you know what document number the
unit was rented on.

U=Undo Only units rented with periodic invoicing are
eligible for the "Undo" feature. Also, the original
rental document must be posted. The unit is
removed from periodic billing and its rental status is
changed from RE=Rented to AV=Available.

B=Bypass Rental status is not changed.

 

See

a —
Note:

———— ——— ————

Do not use rental sales flags of "U" and "R" for the same unit on the same

document.

 

 

POS Command Keys & RSF

Changes to rental status refer to the session date. The date the computer is using is
the system date. The date the workstation is using is the session date. Normally,


84 X5-1 « POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

the system date is the same as the session date unless the DATE command is used
to change the date at a workstation.

Cmd2-Print & Close

RSF=R If there is periodic invoicing, the rental status is changed from
AV=Available to RE=Rented.
RSF=U The line on the document in periodic billing, which refers

to the unit rental, is deleted, and if it is the only line, the entire
document is deleted. The unit's status changes to AV=Available.

RSF=B No changes
Cmd9-Re-open
RSF=R If the document being re- opened is not the original rental,

the rental sales flag is changed to B=Bypass: no changes will be
made when the document is closed.

will be made when the document is closed.

RSF=B No changes.

Cmd10-Void open document

[Cmd15]-Rental Status Maintenance

From any screen in Point of Sale, you can press [Cmd15] to go directly to Rental
Status Maintenance, where you can:

0 Change the rental status.

O Record (or remove) job site.

O Record (or remove) comments as appropriate.

Periodic Invoicing

To make a document eligible for Periodic Invoicing, it is necessary to
enter the following fields on the Sold To screen:

0 Periodic Type
O Periodic Frequency
1 Rental Start Date

Periodic types and their associated frequencies are described in the table below.
See also, CHAPTER X55-3, PERIODIC INVOICING.”


POINT OF SALE X5-1 ¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING 85
a EE er ee Eee een ONG 8D

Periodic Type Associated Periodic Frequency

1= Interval 1-99. Invoiced at set intervals, specified by the
frequency. Example: Type "I" with Frequency=28
is eligible for invoicing every 28 days. An original
invoice with a date of 03/07/93 would be eligible
for periodic invoicing on 04/04/93 and every 28
days thereafter. To send invoices on a timely basis,
Periodic Invoicing would be run every business day.
This is the method most commonly used.

M= Monthly 1-31. Invoiced every month on the day specified by
the frequency. Example: Type "M" with
Frequency=15 is eligible for invoicing on the 15th
of each month. An original invoice with a date of
03/25/93 would be eligible for periodic invoicing on
04/15/93. Assuming that everybody uses either the
Ist or the 15th, Periodic Invoicing could be run
twice a month.

W = Weekly 1-7. Every week on the day specified by the
frequency, where 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday,
3=Wednesday, etc. Example: Type "W" with
Frequency=5 is eligible for invoicing every Friday.
If everybody uses "5," Periodic Invoicing could be
run once a week.

Cloned Rental Documents

An actual invoice is created at the appropriate time. A option in the OPTDIS
Library allows you to choose a cloned document number (IN00099, INO0099A,
IN00099B, etc.) or the next available document number.

When a document with a periodic type and frequency is closed, the following
types of lines are copied to a clone document:
O Miscellaneous unit lines, sales code format "U."
O Miscellaneous quantity lines, sales code format "M
O Miscellaneous description lines, sales code format "D."

 

Notes are especially useful for rental documents, where they can be used to
describe the unit, or terms of the rental; however, Note lines are not copied to the
clone document for periodic invoicing.

Periodic Invoicing Report
The Periodic Invoicing Report (X56-6) lists documents that are eligible for

periodic invoicing. It is similar to the Aged Payables Report: you can request only
those documents that are eligible on the current date, or you can print all


X5-1 « POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

documents that are scheduled for periodic invoicing. See CHAPTER X56-6 for
details.

The same documents will appear at the appropriate time at Periodic Invoicing,
where any invoice can be bypassed or deleted. Also, individual lines can be
deleted or changed. See CHAPTER X55-3 for details.

    
 

Note:
It is your responsibility to remove invoices from Periodic Invoicing when
they no longer apply or the rental is returned.

### Reservations

Each time a part is placed on a open document, a reservation is created for that
part number. When the document is closed, the reservations are filled if the part is
in stock. If the part is not in stock and has to be priority ordered, or the document
is placed on hold, the reservation remains for both the customer and the part
aumber. Quick codes can be used to access part information.

Reservations can be reviewed in several places, which are listed below:

O1 Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

O Reservations by Customer, an Option on the Additional Options Menu,
which is available by pressing [Cmdi 1] from Point of Sale.

OQ) Reservations by Part, which is also an option on the Additional Options
Menu, [Cmd11]} from Point of Sale,

O1 Inquire/Update Reservation Priorities (X342-3) See CHAPTER X343-4,

1 Unclaimed Part Receipt Reports (X342- 4), See CHAPTER X342-4,

Of these, jobs 4 and 5 are probably the most efficient.
Reservations are filled in order by date and time; however, you'll find an OPT
switch in the OPTDIS Library that assigns the following priorities from 1 (high)
to 5 (low):

2 = Customer

3 = Warrantor

4 = Intemal

See DIS LIBRARY OPTIONS in the Appendix.

### Supersession

Supersession information is available in the following options:
- Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

- Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

- Display/Print Price Book (X37-3)

- Point of Sale Detail Line (5-1)

- Part Availability (Cmd12 from X5-1)

- Electronic Parts Catalogs

Except for Display/Print Price Book (X37-3) and Electronic Parts Catalogs,
backward supersession is not handled. The DIS system attempts to sell all parts
from inventory in a forward chain and displays the last part in the chain so it can
be ordered, if necessary. The Electronic Parts Catalog skips intermediate parts and
displays only 1 level of backward and 1 level of forward supersession (the last
part in the chain).

Parts Inquiry (X3-1)

The Supersede code “S” means the part has been superseded by a single part. “M”
means the part has been superseded by multiple parts, only the first
(alphabetically) is displayed. This information is updated by price tape update.

Parts In Inventory

If the entire chain is in inventory, it is displayed at F7=Supersession when the
original part number is entered. If a superseding part is entered, the chain is
displayed from that part forward. You must press F5=Division to check
availability for a part in other divisions.

Parts Not In Inventory
If the original part number is entered, the chain is revealed from the price book
one number at a time in a message at the bottom of the screen. If a superseding
part is entered, the chain is displayed from that part forward.

Parts Posting & Maintenance (X3-2)

Parts In Inventory

Supersession information can be added to any part manually. This is overwritten
when inventory is updated from a Price tape or price book unless the partis ina
class flagged as non-updatable (automatic pricing = N) in Configure Vendor/Class
(X38-1). In the absence of a price book, this information is used by POS to chain
to superseding parts.


92 X5-1 ¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

 

 

Parts Not In Inventory (—

Parts may be added from the price book from any point in a chain, No
supersession information is retrieved, only pricing and the return code. There is
no way to know how many superseding parts there are or to go directly to the end
of the chain.

Display/Print Price Book (X37-3)

The price book displays backward (supersedes) and forward (superseded by)
chains. The “M” indicator comes from the manufacturer and means the part
supersedes many different parts and does not correspond to the “M” indicator
used in Parts Posting & Maintenance, which is created by Price Tape Update (or
manually) and means the part is superseded by multiple parts (kit).

Point of Sale Detail Screen

Point of Sale uses both local inventory and the price book to sell the first available
part in a forward chain, and always displays the last part number in the chain. A
part that has been superseded by multiple parts shows simply *MULTIPLE*.

Part In Inventory

Availability information is displayed. If the request cannot be filled by the first
part entered, the next part in the chain with available quantity will be displayed on
the comment line. After all available parts have been sold, the last part in the
chain can be ordered.

Part Not In Inventory

Regardless of where you start in a chain, the last part in the chain is displayed on
the comment line. If it is not possible to order the part you enter, such as AAI1I7,
you will receive an “Invalid part” message, and the most current part will be
displayed on the comment line. If it is possible to order the part you entered, it
will be displayed on the detail line with a “P” priority code, but the most current
part number will be displayed on the comment line.


POINT OF SALE X5-1 ¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING 93

 

 

 

Note:

 

 

 

   
  
  

You'll be informed about supersession on the availability line. In some
cases, you'll need to delete a priority order line and add the part number
displayed under "Super." To make it convenient to add supersession parts,
the availability line remains even after a line is deleted.

 

Part Availability

Part in Inventory

All superseding parts in the chain that are in inventory are displayed whether they
will be needed to meet the request or not.

Part Not In Inventory

Part Availability searches local inventory, other divisions, and the price book. All
parts in the forward supersession chain will be displayed. If the original part
requested is in the requesting division’s inventory but not available, it will show
“NOT OK.” Parts located in the price book will be indented and show “NOT
OK/PRC BOOK.” If you left-justify the parts and press [Enter] again, the system
will search other divisions for the superseding part and display availability
information. You wil] be able to order the last part in the chain, if necessary. The
system will repeat the quantity, which is adjusted manually as you decide what
parts to sell.

Electronic Parts Catalog

As of 11/5/96, the DIS interface to the parts catalog displays 1 level of backward
supersession and the last part(s) in the forward chain (1 level). If the parts listed
are in the dealer’s inventory, availability and bin location are displayed. No
intermediate parts are shown, regardless of whether the part is in the dealer’s local
inventory or not. Multiple “Superseded by” part numbers indicate a kit. Multiple
“Supersedes” may be from a kit to one part or simply separate parts that have
been superseded by the same part.

Multiple supersession is the most difficult because manufacturers do not make it
clear whether a part is superseded by 3 different single parts or by a kit consisting
of 3 parts. In some cases, the original part number is superseded by several
different part numbers, any one of which can be used to replace the original part.
In other cases, the original part is superseded by a kit composed of several
different part numbers, all of which are required to do the job of the 1 original
part number. In either case, the DIS Business System displays "*MULTIPLE*” in
the "Super." field at Point of Sale. If possible, use the comment field on the Parts


94 X5-1 « POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2
TOMA rw ee

Posting & Maintenance screen to store all part numbers that are required for

Stand-alone parts catalogs (without the DIS interface) display only the last part(s)

### Transferring Parts Between Divisions

In this section, you'll lear 3 methods for transferring parts to other divisions from
Point of Sale: 1) Simple Sale, where the receiving division is treated exactly like
any other customer, and the parts are considered "sold." 2) Order & Transfer,
where parts are recorded as "transferred" to the receiving division, which creates
and receives a priority order for the parts. 3) Menu option X3.12-1, Transfer
Parts.

Simple Sale

In this case, one division simply sells parts to a division in exactly the same way it
would sell parts to any other customer. This method is satisfactory when very few
parts are involved and no change in stocking levels is required. Accounting
transactions are generated in the transferring (source) division by the invoice. A
journal entry is required to receive the parts into inventory in the receiving
division.

Oi Set up a system address for the receiving division in Receivables Maintenance
(X11-2).

O Use Price Table Maintenance (X52-9) to establish default pricing if it is
different from Dealer List. See CHAPTER X52-9, PRICE TABLE
MAINTENANCE.

O Open the Point of Sale document to the receiving division and proceed as
usual.

Order and Transfer

In this case, the division that needs parts (receiving division) creates a priority
order, which is filled by the division that has the parts available (transferring
division). The transaction is recorded as a “transfer,” instead of a "sale." This
method is more appropriate when many parts are involved and some change in
stocking levels would be appropriate. Accounting transactions are generated by
invoices in both divisions; however, a journal entry is required to receive the parts
into inventory in the receiving division just as any other order requires.

Procedures for the receiving division and the transferring division are described
separately.

Receiving Division
The receiving division needs the parts to complete a sale to a customer. The
sales document is handled exactly the same as for any other sale.
O Open a sales document to the customer.


96 X5-1 ¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

0) Proceed to place parts on the document as usual. Since the parts that will
come from the other division are not available, they will be placed on the
document with a "P" in the column labeled "TDP." When the document is
closed or placed on hold, the parts will be included in the priority order
queue.

O Finalize the priority order in the Priority Orders job (X5-3). On the sales
document the "P" changes to a "p."

1 Send the priority order to the division that has available parts. See
“Transferring Division,” which follows.

O When the parts are received, use Receive Order (X342-2) to receive the

priority order. On the sales document, the "p" changes to an "a," which
means that the parts can now be sold to the customer.

Transferring Division
The first 2 steps for the division that has available parts are the same as for the
simple sale described above.
O Set up a system address for the receiving division in Receivables
Maintenance (X11-2).

O) Use Price Table Maintenance (X52-9) to establish default pricing if it is
different from Dealer List. See CHAPTER X52-9, PRICE TABLE
MAINTENANCE.

The next steps record the parts as “transfer sales" on the Parts Management

Report (X36-2) and stop sales history update.

{1 Open the Point of Sale document to the receiving division.

1 On the Sold To screen, place any character in the field labeled "Transfer."

1 Proceed to the detail screen. As parts are entered on the detail line, place
any character in the field labeled "No Demand" to prohibit sales history
update. This step is important for future system-generated stock orders,
which are based on demand criteria established in Configure Vendor/Class

(X38-1).

Note:

Consider the following example:

Clem Robinson purchased a used piece of equipment from you. He brings the
equipment into your dealership to have the universal joint replaced. The joint is
under warranty, but the manufacturer will not pay for the service to replace the
joint. You want Clem to purchase his next piece of equipment at your dealership
and you want him to use your shop for service. You decide to charge him '% of the
normal labor rate. Who's going to pay?

- Clem will pay for % of the labor (Customer charge).
- The company will pay for ¥% of the labor (Internal charge).
" The manufacturer will pay for the part (Warrantor charge).

Point of Sale Invoicing allows you to charge 4% labor to Clem on one line, % of

the labor to the company on another line, and the part to the manufacturer on a

third line, all on the same repair order. To accomplish this, follow the steps below.

C1 Set up a system address for each warrantor in Receivables Maintenance

(X11-2). For the general ledger account, use your Warranty Receivables
(or Warranty Expense, if you handle warranty work as an expense),
Identify the address as a Warrantor by placing a “W" in the field labeled
“Int/War."

O Set up a system address for your company in Receivables Maintenance
(X11-2). For the general ledger account, use an expense account. Identify
the address as Internal by placing an "I" in the field labeled “Int/War."

O In Security Maintenance (X6-6), establish the address created in the
previous step as the default internal address number. When a work order is
opened at Point of Sale Invoicing, the system uses this address on the Sold
To screen in the field labeled "Internal Address"; however, it can be
changed for the current document.


100 X5-1 e POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

 


In Sales Code Maintenance (X52-3), check all sales codes to make sure the
debits and credits for Internal Documents and Warranty Documents are
correct. "*AUTO" uses the general ledger account entered in Receivables
Maintenance. HINT: The easiest way to check these fields is to go into
X52-3, press [Cmd1], and request a printout of all sales codes.

At Point of Sale, follow these steps:

Qo

Qo

Open a document to a customer (or internal unit). The document type must
be "W" (see CHAPTER X52-2, DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION
MAINTENANCE).

If the document is opened to a customer, press [Cmd16] to scroll through
the units, which were bought from your dealership, or enter the appropriate
information on the Make/Model line.
If the document is opened to a customer, the field labeled "Internal
Address #" displays the defauit set up in Security Maintenance.
Intemal Address #: Change the Internal Address #, if necessary. Detail
lines on which the field "I/W"="I" are charged to this address. If the
document is opened to a unit, leave the field blank if you want all internal
charges to go to the unit.
Unit #: If the customer bought the unit from you or if you use the DIS
Service Management program, a unit number is displayed in the field
labeled "Unit #;” otherwise, the field is not used (no input is allowed).
Warranty Address #: If some charges will be directed to a warrantor or
other third party, enter the corresponding address number in the field
labeled "Warranty Address #." Detail lines on which the field "I/W"="W"
are charged to this address.

Detail Screen

On the detail screen, lines that display the "I/W" field are eligible for split billing.
One line can be charged to one address; therefore, to charge the customer for ¥2 of
the labor and absorb the other / as an internal charge, 2 lines are necessary.
When the field labeled "I/W" is left blank, the charge goes to the customer (or

unit).

When a work order is closed, as many as 3 separate documents, all with the same
document number, may be printed.

Customer Document
A document will always be printed for the customer even if all the charges
were Warranty and Internal. The customer's address and name appear the top
of the document. All detail lines appear on the document; however, the total
reflects only what the customer owes. The extended amounts on the Warranty
and internal lines are marked “N/C" (no charge).


X5-1 * POINT OF SALE INVOICING 101 1

 

Internal Document

When the document was opened to a customer, an internal document is printed
only if the field labeled "I/W"="I" on one or more detail lines. The address
number at the top of the document will be the Internal Address # or Unit #
charged. If the "Internal Address #" field contained a valid address number on
the Sold To screen, that Internal Address # will be charged. If the "Internal
Address #" field was blank, and the “Unit #" field contained an Unit number,
that unit number will be charged.

Warranty Document

A warranty document is printed only if the field labeled "I/W"="W" on one or
more detail lines. The address number at the top of the document will be the
Warranty Address # selected in the “Warranty Address #" field on the Sold To
screen.

The mode is displayed at the top of the screen: blank for Active Documents, "Std
Jobs," or “History.” The screen above illustrates the second session and the
selection of History Documents mode.

. Lines from any document can be copied to any other document. Most often, this
feature will be used to copy standard jobs to a current work order; however, it is
not limited in any way. For example, if you want to keep a record of work that
was done outside your shop. If the work was similar to your own standard jobs,
you can copy them to the history document.

Active Documents, Standard Jobs, and History Documents are ali created and
modified within Point of Sale Invoicing. The 3 types of documents are similar;
however, differences in the Entrance and Sold To screens for each mode are
discussed in their respective sections.

### Active Documents

Active Documents are the usual invoices and work orders created for customers.
Active documents that include serial numbers become history documents after
they are closed and posted.

The Entrance screen for Active Documents, illustrated below, appears when you

Also, note the field labeled "Job Code.” Labor lines can be added to jobs already

on open work orders by using this field instead of the Service Labor Entry job,

which has been eliminated. See the section "Labor Lines."


108 —_X5-1 * POINT OF SALE INVOICING RELEASE 2.2

 

STANDARD JOBS Cc

Inquire/Update Job Codes has been eliminated: standard jobs are created in Point
of Sale Invoicing where they have the same format as work orders. Standard jobs
can be copied to work orders (active documents), other standard jobs, and history
documents. By reviewing work orders, you can identify lines that should be set up
as standard jobs in order to eliminate repetitive typing.

As a standard job is created, it is associated with a group code and identified as a
Group:Job. Service tables can be constructed by selecting Group:Job
combinations. When a unit is associated with a table, the Group:Job combinations
are automatically selected in Recommended Maintenance. In addition, any
Group:Job can be added to Recommended Maintenance.

Organization

You can organize standard jobs in a way that is most convenient for your
dealership. In many cases, it is more practical to set up recommended
maintenance by make/model and series code than by make/model and year.

To help you understand the concepts introduced in this release, a consistent (
example using group and table codes of 5000 is provided. You'll see how standard

jobs are associated with this code at Point of Sale. Then you'll learn how to create

a service table for recommended maintenance by selecting standard jobs from the

group.

In the unique groups, which pertain to different make/models, jobs will be similar
and should follow a similar naming pattern, such as OILCHG (Oil Change) or
WINTER (Winterization). By maintaining a consistent naming convention, you
can easily remember how to locate a particular job in any group. This is
particularly true if you use numerical codes. For example, Job 1 for Group 6600
(6600: 1) and Job 1 for Group 7000 (7000:1) may be for an oil change, even
though the jobs require different parts and labor.

Using the same name for the group and table makes it easy to set up
recommended maintenance. Remember, groups are used at Point of Sale; tables
are used for Recommended Maintenance. Any Group:Job combination can be
added to the Recommended Maintenance screen. Also, any Group:Job
combination can be copied at Point of Sale.


POINT OF SALE X5-1 ¢ POINT OF SALE INVOICING 109
EE SALE INVIING NO

Setting up Group Codes

The Service Management System assumes a default group code, *JOBS, which
must be set up as an Accounts Receivable address number. This is similar to the
Point of Sale_CASHd address. If you want standard jobs to be associated with

unique group codes, you'll need to set up corresponding address numbers.

In the following example, an address number is created for the unique Group
5000.

Standard jobs retain their identity on a work order. Each job is assigned a unique
line number prefix, such as "01" in the example illustrated above. Lines within the
job are numbered sequentially, beginning with "0010." Standard jobs are added
with a new prefix line number and a comment line containing the job code and
description. To make the detail screen easier to read, you may want to use a note
line that begins with a special character, such as "*J," so it will appear before the
job detail lines.

Special customer pricing, supersession, and availability are checked as each line
is copied to an active document.

documents cannot be re-opened.

primarily used to record service that was not done in your shop. These history
documents can be closed, reopened, and modified.. Inventory is not affected.
Before a work order is closed, it is an "Active Document." After it is closed and
posted, a work order that includes a serial number is copied to history where it is
saved as a "History Document." In addition, service history can be reviewed in
Inquire/Update Service Units (X10-1).

History Entrance Screen

The Entrance screen for History Documents is illustrated below. This screen
operates like any Entrance screen with the addition of a "Serial Number" prompt.

## CHAPTER X6-6

SECURITY MAINTENANCE

### Introduction

A Division is usually a store. Security Maintenance allows you to add or
delete a division. Information associated with each division such as name
and address, security, etc is changed or supplied in Security Maintenance.
Master Security for the entire system can be changed in Security
Maintenance.

     

Note:

 
 
 

  

The master security screen, where division codes are established, also
controls the order in which divisions are processed by jobs which
affect more than one division, such as End of Day (X1-9) and
Combined End of Month Procedure (X1.10-2).

   
   

 
 

 

### Setting Up Master Security

Master Security is used to gain access to the division code information.
This is the main security code. With use of this code, any other
security information becomes available. Only persons with the highest
security level should be given this code.

THE MASTER CODE WILL BE @ UNTIL IT IS CHANGED THE
FIRST TIME

Since we have just informed all readers that the master security code
is @, it would be a good idea to change it.

At the Security Maintenance screen, type @ in the Division Code field.
The @ will not display until Enter is pressed. Press Enter.


[2] X6-6 SECURITY MAINTENANCE C .

The Security Maintenance screen will display with @ in the Master Code
field. The Division Code field will be blank.

The Master Code field is five characters long. You must use the @ in the
first position of the field. There are no exceptions. Select up to 4
characters, letters, or numbers for the rest of the code.

Take two print screens of the Master Code. They should be placed in a
safe place. We suggest the dealer principal's home or perhaps in a lock box
off the premises.

When the print keys have been made, press Enter. Your code is changed.

CO


ADDING A DIVISION

X6-6 SECURITY MAINTENANCE [=]

At the Security Maintenance screen, type the master code in the Division
Code field. Press Enter. The following screen displays:

Division code .
Master Code

Number of Stores .....

Store Codes:
1. Lieoo 2.
7. 8.
13. a.
19. 20.

### Security Maintenance X€600-101 1

 

The division codes are listed under Store codes. In the above example, we
have two divisions. To add a division, change the Number of Stores to 3
and press Field Exit. Type the new division code beside the number 3

under Store Codes.

The first letter of the division code is the bridge that ties all numbering
systems and parts to the division. For example, A in the division A1000, is
the first letter of all general ledger accounts. Cash is A100 and so on. The
first letter of the division code you choose must be the first letter of your
general ledger accounts. Use up to five characters.

Note:

The order in which divisions are processed by jobs that affect more

than one division, such as End of Day (X1-9) and Combined End of
| Month Procedure (X1.10-2), is established on this screen. The order

can be changed at any time.

 

Take two print screens of this screen and put them in a safe place.

When Enter is pressed, the division is added.

### Changing A Division Code

At the Security Maintenance screen, type the master code in the Division
Code field. Press Enter.

To change a division code, type over the old division code. You cannot
change the initial alpha character. It must still be the first letter of your
general ledger accounts. For example, change B1000 to B. You do not
have to use all the spaces. The first letter is the bridge to your general
ledger accounts and parts. If you change the letter, the bridge is broken.

When the change is made, take two print screens of the screen and put
them in a safe place. Press Enter. The division code has been changed.

[| X6-1 BACKUP & RESTORE FILES MENU

Overview of Menu Options

Immediate Backup

An immediate backup is appropriate if you want to do a critical job, such
as monthly billing, in the middle of the work day. If a critical job is
already underway, immediate backup cancels itself; if not, the system
checks for active jobs and gives you a chance to ask people to sign off or
cancel the jobs manually. Although you may select immediate backup to
tape and initialize the tape at the same time, you will probably want to
request backup to disk and move it to tape later. A dedicated system is
required only during the backup to disk. Work can continue as backups are
moved to tape.

Work with Automated Backup Schedules

Use this option to schedule backups for each file set and end of day jobs
for each division. It is not necessary to repeat this initial setup work unless
you want to change the schedule or you add another division and need to
schedule end of day jobs for it.

Create Daily Backup Tapes

Use this option to initialize and label tapes that will be used for daily
backups. You may create tapes for as many days as you need. You will be
prompted to insert the next day's tape. You may use this option to create
backup tapes to replace ones you want to keep, such as the backups that
follow Monthly Billing, Accounting End of Month, or End of Year.

Restore from Backup

Use this option to restore a file set from disk or tape. The DIS Backup
system keeps a log of all backups that have ever been done and what
happened to them, whether they are on disk, tape, or have been deleted and
are unavailable. If the backup you want is on disk or tape, it can be


X6-1 BACKUP & RESTORE FILES MENU [= |

restored.

Altention! Customers who have used previous versions of the DIS
Business System: Restoring data files no longer involves deleting the file
set you are currently using; in fact, the option to Delete Data Files has
been disabled. If you need to remove a file set, such as Z-files
permanently, the Response Line can help you.

Restoring a file set is as simple as selecting the backup from a list in
Restore from Backup.

As long as you find out before the next backup, you can "undo" the
restore. Before a file set is restored, the system backs up the current file
set as an "Undo" save file and leaves it on the disk until the next regularly
scheduled automated backup. If you have restored the wrong backup or if
you simply want to return to the current data after running some reports
from an old backup, all you do is press a function key. See F10-Undo
Restore.

 

Work with Backups

Work with Backups maintains a log of all backups and where they are
(disk, tape, deleted, etc.). From this log, you can select any backup on disk
and delete it or move it to tape. Backups to disk are not deleted until they
are moved to tape or manually deleted. /t is important to be aware of
backups on disk and deal with them in a timely manner to prevent
problems with disk space.

Prepare Tape for Backup

You can save time by using this option to initialize tapes to have on hand
when you need to do an immediate backup.

No jobs that use data files can be running during the DIS Business System
backup. The SupportPRO business system interface (BSI) is such a job
and it cannot be left active overnight or backup will fail. There is a BSI
Job active for each SupportPRO client. Every night before you leave,
follow these instructions to allow backup to complete.

O On each Rumba-DIS session, obtain a sign-on screen.
Q Stop Case Communications.
O Exit the SupportPRO application. This cancels the BSI job so backup
will complete.

### Security & Setup

The Backup security code is required for all options on the Backup &
Restore Menu. Since daily backups are automated, no security is required.

Setup work is minimal and consists of the following steps:

1) Use option 3, Create Daily Backup Tapes, to initialize and label tapes
that will be used for daily backups. Tapes are labeled MONDAY
through SUNDAY.

2) Use option 2, Work with Automated Backup Schedules, to select the

file set(s) you want to backup, a time, persons who will be notified to
insert the backup tapes, etc.

3) Also, in Work with Automated Backup Schedules, you will schedule

End of Day jobs by division. End of Day jobs are done after backup
and include:

Accounting End of Day. A S/36 printer ID can be designated.
Parts End of Day. A S/36 printer ID can be designated.

Index Rebuild. Indexes are rebuilt for the file set. If they have
already been run when the system processes a division, they will
not be run again. The following indexes are rebuilt: Marketing,
Point of Sale, Receivables, and Vendor.

4) If you want to initialize and label a tape to have on hand for immediate
backups, use option 6, Prepare Tape for Immediate Backup. Tapes can
be initialized at the time you do an immediate backup; however, it
makes the backup less immediate.

COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

What's the Best Thing About Backup?

Backup is always done to disk first, provided there is enough space. An
immediate backup to disk takes about 10-20 minutes for an average file
set, and this is the only time you need a dedicated system. After that, the
backup can be moved to tape manually, which takes longer but does not
interfere with other work.

L


X6-1 BACKUP & RESTORE FILES MENU |

What Happens to Active Jobs?

Backup does not proceed as long as there are active jobs. Since there is
always a possibility that somebody will forget to sign off, you can set up
backup to warn users every 2 minutes and cancel active jobs after 10
minutes. Bear in mind that there is always a danger of losing valuable
data when jobs are canceled. See also the section on Case
Communications & Backup, which appears earlier in this chapter.

Backup will not cancel the following critical jobs:
= Monthly Billing

any terminal).

Post Source Documents

Accounting End of Month

Payables File Maintenance

General Ledger File Maintenance

Price Tape Update

Parts End of Month Procedures

Point of Sale End of Month Procedure

Restore Bearing Interchange

If critical jobs remain active, backup is canceled after 5 hours.

a
NOTE
The Point of Sale print job, DISPSPPnu (Pn=S/36 printer ID and u=file set
ID) is automatically canceled by a regularly scheduled backup; however, it is
often active at the time of an immediate backup. It can be canceled safely as
long as no one is using Point of Sale Invoicing.


SECURITY & CONFIGURATION


X6-1 BACKUP & RESTORE FILES MENU co

What's the Most Important Thing to Remember?

Put the right tape in the tape drive every night.

Reliable backups are your best insurance against disaster. Several
conditions govern successful backups. Assuming that critical jobs have
ended, the following conditions must be true for a successful backup:
i) A tape must be placed in the drive.

2) It must have the correct label.

3) The tape drive must be working.

If even one of these conditions is not true, the system backs up to disk,
provided there is enough room.

Are Backups to Disk OK?

Yes and no. Backups on disk are condensed and disk space will not
normally be a problem; however, old backups are not deleted
automatically. If backups are allowed to accumulate on your disk,
performance may suffer. At 90% of disk capacity, the system skips the
disk backup and attempts to back up to tape. If for any reason, the tape
backup is unsuccessful, you are left with no backup at all.

It is your responsibility to move disk backups to tape as soon as possible.

Backups are deleted as soon as they are successfully moved to tape or
when you manually delete them using the option, Work with Backups.

RELEASE 2.2 LL


X6-1 BACKUP & RESTORE FILES MENU [=]

If Backup Fails, What Do | Do?

Backup fails completely only when there is no available disk Space and no
tape or the wrong tape in the drive. First, move all old backups to tape in
Work with Backups. As they are moved to tape, backups are deleted from
the disk. If there are no backups on disk, find out what's wrong and free
space somehow. Make sure the correct tape is placed in the tape drive
before the next scheduled backup.

Which Tape Do | Use?

Backup uses a 24-hour clock (military time). Noon is 12:00; midnight is
24:00. Backup time is from 8:01 on the first day until 8:00 the next day.
The system expects Monday's tape from 8:01 A.M. on Monday until 8:00
A.M. on Tuesday. Files on backup tapes are active for 7 days. If active
files are found, backup will append (add to the end) the next backup.
After 7 days, the system will re-initialize the tape with the same label.

Examples. If backup time is scheduled for 23:59 on Monday, the system
expects Monday's tape and backs up Monday's data at one minute until
midnight. If backup is scheduled for 2:00, the system expects Monday's
tape and backs up Monday's data at 2:00 Tuesday morning. At 8:01
Tuesday morning, the system expects Tuesday's tape. If backup is
scheduled for 14:00 and it is Tuesday, the system expects Tuesday's tape.

SECURITY & CONFIGURATION


X6-1 BACKUP & RESTORE FILES MENU Co

What If I Forget the Tape?

Provided there is enough room, the DIS Backup System always backs up
to disk first. The disk backup is deleted only after backup to tape is
successful. If you fail to put in the tape, or if it is the wrong one, a backup
will be done to disk; however, you should move it to tape as soon as
possible.

How Will | Know If Backup is Not Successful?

When backups fail, messages are sent only to the 2 user profiles set up in
Work with Automated Backup Schedules (X61-2) and not to all
workstations. Messages received alert you to the following conditions: (

1) The wrong tape was in the drive and the system backed up to disk only.
Move the backup to tape ASAP using option 5, Work with Backups.

2) The system could not back up to disk, but backup to tape was
successful. This means your disk is over 90% full, and you need to free
some space ASAP. Failure to do so may impact performance. In
addition, if the system cannot back up to disk or tape in the future,
backup will fail completely.

3) Backup failed completely: no room for a backup to disk and no tape or
the wrong tape in the drive (or the tape drive is not operating).

How Do | Delete & Restore?

The option to Delete Data Files has been disabled. If you need to remove a
file set, such as Z-files permanently, the Response Line can help you. With
the new backup, restoring a file set is as simple as selecting the backup

RELEASE 2.2 LU


 

from a list in Restore from Backup. The DIS Backup system keeps a log
of all backups that have ever been done and what happened to them,
whether they are on disk, tape, or have been deleted and are unavailable.
If the backup you want is on disk or tape, it can be restored.

WARNING! If a backup appears in the list with a blank File Location
(neither On Tape nor On Disk), it could be incomplete and should not be
testored.

What if | Restore the Wrong Backup?

As long as you find out before the next backup, you can "undo" the
testore. Before a file set is restored, the syste backs up the current file
set as an "Undo" save file and leaves it on the disk until the next regular
backup. If you have restored the wrong backup or if you simply want to
return to the current data after running some reports from an old backup,
all you do is press a function key.

SECURITY & CONFIGURATION

### Technical Notes

Work with Backups is a log which lists all backups with the most
recent first. The list is maintained indefinitely, and there is currently no
way to remove items.

When backups are saved to disk, dealer files are saved in a special
library, DISSAVLIB. The files are deleted when they are moved to
tape; otherwise, they accumulate until the disk is full.

When a file set is restored, the current file set is saved temporarily in
DISSAVLIB but the files are deleted at the next backup.

The major job steps involved in a regularly scheduled backup occur in the
following order:

3)
2)
3)

4)
5)
6)

8)
9)

Hold the job queue (QBATCH)

Stop DISPOSPRT subsystem.

Check for critical jobs. Stop the backup process if critical jobs remain
active after 5 hours.

Check for active, non-critical jobs. Issue warnings and cancel them
after the specified time.

Allocate (lock) all files to be saved.

Run Backup in QCTL: Save current file set in DISSAVLIB. Save the
backup to tape, then delete it from DISSAVLI. If no tape is present,
issue warning message.

Delete the "Undo" save file from DISSAVLL, if any.

Deallocate (unlock) files.

Run End of Day Jobs.

10) Release the job queue (QBATCH).

AUDIT REPORTS

### Introduction

In Configuration, you may select one audit report to be ran when Accounting End
of Day is run. You can also specify a printer for the Time Clock report to be
printed on. This may or may not be the same as the End of Day printer. Audit
Reports will be helpful to the Service Managers as they prepare to review the
day's work and make any necessary adjustments.

If the Thermo King dealer OPT (X63B-6) is on, Thermo King job codes are
included on the audit reports, but, due to space constraints, job code descriptions
are truncated to 24 characters on the By Technician report and 26 characters on
the By Work Order report. No subtotals or summaries by job codes have been
provided since this information is produced by Thermo Komm.

INTRODUCTION CC® PSO file,

Time Clock is a software solution for tracking time and billing charges. It is
available as an additional product, which can be purchased separately from DIS.
If the Thermo King dealer OPT (X63B-6) is on, Thermo King job codes are
available and work the same as in Point of Sale. Because of its enhanced features
and reporting ability, Thermo King dealers are encouraged to use Time Clock
instead of Technician Time Card Entry.

Time Clock is a punch-out system with full reporting capabilities. To make it easy
to upgrade, Technician Time Card Entry looks and feels like Time Clock’s
Review by Technician except that it does not use work type codes, status codes,
or technicians’ profiles. Technician Time Card Entry and Time Clock are
mutually exclusive; that is, if Time Clock has been installed, Technicians Time
Card Entry is not available and vice versa.

By simulating a time clock on the AS/400, it provides the following functions:

=  Validates and accumulates job information

= Keeps an unlimited amount of history making it easy to compare productivity
in Different years

= Requires minimal disk space: 5 MB per year for 10 technicians, each with 5
work orders and 4 miscellaneous punches, working 6 days/week

- Describes work by status codes and work type codes, both of which are
completely user-defined and can be tailored to your work environment

= Automatically charges overtime on selected work types (optional)

= Start/end of day can be customized for each technician's schedule

= Provides a "window" or grace period during which a punch is the same as the
start/end time of day

- Directly linked with Point of Sale Invoicing with command key that goes to
Review by Work Order

- Places billable labor lines on Point of Sale work orders when you press
[Enter] in Time Clock

= Allows management to review charges by technician/date or by work order

® Provides excellent management reports


2 X5-11 ¢ TIME CLOCK MENU RELEASE 2.2

- Includes an option to print one Time Clock audit report at Accounting End of
Day

= Protects integrity of reports by disabling labor lines at Point of Sale, but
provides access if necessary See CHAPTER X5.11-3, CONFIGURATION.

= Provides access to Thermo King job codes just like in Point of Sale provided
the Thermo King dealer OPT (X63B-6) is on.

Point of Sale

Billable Time Clock entries are placed directly on Point of Sale documents when
[Enter] is pressed in Time Clock, Review by Technician and by Work Order.

Because the integrity of Time Clock Reports will be compromised if labor lines
are entered through Point of Sale, they are disabled when Time Clock is installed.
From time-to-time, it may be necessary for someone to enter a labor line from
Point of Sale; therefore, a process has been provided whereby Point of Sale access
can be unlocked for one or more users. See POS Access Lock in CHAPTER
X5.11-3, CONFIGURATION.

 

### Warning

To ensure the accuracy of Time Clock reports, make sure all labor lines that are
entered at Point of Sale are duplicated in Time Clock. Better yet, don't use labor
lines at Point of Sale at all.

Thermo King Job Codes

Time Clock follows the same specifications and limits for creating Thermo King

warranty claims as in Point of Sale Invoicing, which are:

> One claim per work order

» Each claim can contain multiple segments (one segment only for a “Service
Parts Only Claim”)

» One cause of failure (COF) per segment

Up to 27 part lines per segment (one part line only for a “Service Parts Only

Claim”)

Up to 9 Misc. parts per claim

Up to 3 outside invoices per claim

Up to 10 comment lines per claim

Up to 18 serialized parts per claim

No labor lines on “Service Parts Only Claims”


yurveyr

Note that the restriction of only 14 job codes per claim has been removed.


POINT OF SALE X5-11 e TIME CLOCK MENU §

Command key option from Point of Sale

From the detail screen at Point of Sale Invoicing (X5-1), [Cmd14] takes the user
directly to the labor lines for that work order in Time Clock's Review by Work
Order option, where lines can be changed (for a more thorough discussion, see the
heading Review by Technician or Work Order). Pressing [Cmd1] returns to Point
of Sale.

Punch-out

Time Clock is a “punch out" system. After an employee "punches" in,
subsequent entries describe the activity (work, lunch, break, etc.) that has just
been completed. Time Clock automatically calculates the time that has elapsed
since the previous entry. In the review options, Time Clock will calculate the
punch-out time of day if the time reported is furnished, or hours reported if the
punch-out time of day is furnished.

Review by Technician or Work Order

Jn Review by Technician, new time data can be added to a technician's day ora
whole day can be entered; however, in Review by Work Order, labor lines cannot
be added or deleted--they can only be changed to billable or non-billable. Lines
can also be changed to internal or warranty provided there is an internal or
warranty address on the Sold To screen at point of sale.

Review by Technician is for a specified date. All punches made by the technician
for that date are displayed; therefore, the reviewer is working with consecutive
time periods for the technician's day.

By contrast, Review by Work Order shows all labor lines for all dates and all
technicians on a selected work order. Lines are displayed in the same order as
they appear on the point of sale detail screen. Additions, deletions, or changes to
time would affect the technician's time on other, unidentified work orders;
therefore, they are not allowed. Lines can be changed from billable to
non-billable, which deletes them from the work order, but does not delete the time
from the technician's day, and the lines can still be seen in Review by Technician.


6 X5-11 » TIME CLOCK MENU RELEASE 2.2

Work Status Codes & Work Type Codes

Technicians' work is described by work status codes, such as Break, Lunch,
Repair, Diagnostics, Waiting for Parts, Job Complete. It is further defined by
work type, such as Regular, Welding, etc. These codes are completely
user-defined and should be tailored to your work environment.

### Warning

Once work status codes and work type codes
have been set up and are in use, they should not
be changed, because to do so alters historical
data.

 

 

Overtime

Automatic overtime can be specified for any work type, such as Regular or

Welding. When this type of work is done outside of normal working hours, the

default start/end of day or the individual technician's start/end of day, the

technician's overtime rate is charged automatically. It is possible to designate a

"window" during which a punch is considered the same as the start/end of day. a
For example, you can specify a window of 10 minutes, which means that if the

normal start of day is 8:00 a.m., any punch from 7:50 to 8:10 would be the same

as 8:00 a.m. The window prevents many small overtime charges due to slight

variations in punch-in and punch-out times.

Service Management
Only the time and billing charges that are posted to work orders become part of
service history.

Reports
An audit report is printed at Accounting End of Day. In addition, audit

reports, which focus on technicians, work orders (same as the End of Day
Report), or date and time, can be requested at any time.

### Configuration

### Introduction

Use this option to configure default values for Time Clock to use, including
starting and ending times for a typical day, and selection of a Time Clock report
that will be printed when Accounting End of Day is run. Configuration can be at a
company level or customized for individual divisions.

This ‘option is also used to grant or remove access to Point of Sale labor lines.
Because the integrity of Time Clock Reports will be compromised if labor lines
are entered through Point of Sale, they are disabled when Time Clock is installed.
From time-to-time, it may be necessary for someone to enter a labor line from
Point of Sale; therefore, a process has been provided whereby Point of Sale access
can be unlocked for one or more users.

Usually, a particular user will be granted permission enter labor lines at Point of
Sale to meet an emergency, and then it will be revoked. See POS ACCESS
LOCK.

 

### Warning

To ensure the accuracy of Time Clock reports, make sure all labor lines that are
entered at Point of Sale are duplicated in Time Clock. Better yet, don't use labor
lines at Point of Sale at all.

The rules governing the sales code and I/W field are summarized in the 3 tables
below. For further clarification, see the text that follows.

Step 1: How the Default Sales Code is Determined in Time Clock

Time Clock Uses the Default Sales Code for:

Sales Code. If, in the customer's master record, the Int/War field is blank, the
customer sales code default is used; if "I," the internal sales code default is
used; if "W," the warranty sales code default is used. For customer addresses
that are Internal or Warranty (Int/Warr="I" or "W" in Receivables
Maintenance (X11-2), the /W field may be blank, in which case
corresponding addresses are not required on the Point of Sale document.
Individual lines are not marked "I" or "W" on the document; therefore,
separate Internal and Warranty documents are not generated.

I/W field. If "Default for lines on war docs" is blank, the I/W field on the
Time Clock screen will be blank; if it is "W," the I/W field on the Time Clock
screen will be “W." Any time the I/W field is "I" or "W," the corresponding
address numbers must be present on the Sold To screen of the Point of Sale
document.

Changing. Both fields can be changed on the Time Clock screen.

Status Code Billing. If a status code with a billing code of "I" or "W" is
selected, the I/W flag will be changed to match it automatically, and the
corresponding Internal or Warranty address is required to be on the Point of
Sale document (Sold To screen). Labor lines will be entered as "I" and "W"
lines on the document.

Document Opened to a Unit. The default intemal sales code from Time
Clock Configuration is used.

Document Opened to Internal or Warranty Customer. If the customer is a
warranty or internal customer (Int/War field on the customer's master record
in Receivables Maintenance has a value of "I" or "W"), system addresses are
not required on the Sold To screen unless the I/W field in Time Clock is set to
'T" or "W."

Thermo King Warranty Documents. Even if the Point of Sale document is a
Thermo King warranty document, which is indicated by setting the TK field
on the Sold To screen to "T", system addresses are required on the Sold To
screen in order to mark lines as internal or warranty.

 

### Warning

Job codes can be used on non-warranty lines. This is true regardless of whether
TK War=T or not. If you suspect that a job code has not been processed correctly,
make sure the line is a warranty line or that TK Warr=T on the work order.

## CHAPTER X5.11-5

REVIEW BY WORK ORDER

### Introduction

This option, which is similar to Review by Technician, is used to review billing
and make sure that charges accurately reflect the work that was done. This
function is not available to most technicians—usually only the parts manager or
accounting staff are allowed to review or change time clock data. It can be
accessed by way of the Time Clock Menu or by pressing [Cmd14] from the detail
screen at Point of Sale Invoicing (X5-1), which takes you directly to the detail
screen of labor lines for the current work order.

Charges are placed directly on point of sale documents directly from this job.
Nothing is posted to the general ledger until the work order is closed and posted.
Default labor sales codes set up in Configuration for customer, internal, or
warranty labor are used.

Lines cannot be added or deleted in Review by Work Order; however, some
changes can be made to individual punch-out lines. Lines can be changed to
billable or non-billable. Lines can be charged to internal or warranty provided the
respective internal or warranty addresses are entered on the Sold To screen of the
work order. Hours Reported cannot be changed because doing so would impact
technicians' time on other, unidentified work orders.

The following fields can be changed without deleting and re-entering lines in this
job:

Time Clock status code

Time Clock work type code

Field (Y/N)

Hours Billed

Rate

Tax and discount codes

Billing entity (Customer, Internal, Warrantor, None)

Notes:

## CHAPTER X5.11-4

REVIEW BY TECHNICIAN

### Introduction

This option, which is similar to Review by Work Order, is used to review billing
and make sure that charges accurately reflect the work technicians have done
before work orders are closed and posted. This function is not available to most
technicians—usually only the parts manager or accounting staff are allowed to
review or change Time Clock data. If the Thermo King OPT is on (X63B-6), the
Review by Technician screen displays job code fields, which are illustrated on
page 12.

In this job, as opposed to Review by Work Order, one technician's time is
displayed for a selected date for all the work orders that technician works with on
that day. Consecutive time periods that make up the technician's entire day are
displayed in order by punch-out time to make it easy to see how the day was
spent. Lines can be added, deleted, and changed.

Charges are placed on the point of sale documents directly from this job;
however, nothing is posted to the general ledger until the document is closed and
posted.

Changes can be made to individual punch-out lines, or a day's entries can be
created. The default labor sales codes set up in Configuration for customer,
intemal, or warranty labor are used. Shortcuts expedite the process. For example:
if you enter the elapsed time, the system can calculate the punch-out time, or if
you enter the punch-out time, the system can caiculate the elapsed time. The
following fields can be changed without deleting and re-entering lines in this job:
= Time Clock status code

Time Clock work type code

Field (Y/N)

Hours Reported and Hours Billed

Rate

Tax and discount codes

Billing entity (Customer, Internal, Warrantor, or Non-billable)

Comment
Thermo King job code (available only if the Thermo King dealer OPT (X63B-
6) is on).

The expectation is that you will be using job codes; therefore, you'll go into
“lookup” mode when you press [Enter] on the Time Card Entry screen. If TK
Warr=T on the work order and Bill=W on the labor line, a job code is
required.

 

To skip a job code, the following conditions must be true:
1) TK Warr=blank on the work order
2) No job code is entered

3) Billed hours are entered

Also, if you don’t want to use a job code, you can press F3=Exit after you enter
the series of Thermo King related screens.

The "TK Warr" flag on the Sold To screen at Point of Sale cannot be changed if
there is a warranty line on the work order.

Job Code Description

 

 

This message gives you a chance to enter the description and the rate (there is no
flat rate for miscellaneous job codes) rather than requiring you to bring the line
down again to change it after it is added. The message is necessary at least for
new operators since they do not normally see the whole line again unless there is
an error. Without a message, they will wonder what they did wrong. This also
gives them a change to review the whole line together to see if their choice of a
miscellaneous job code requires further refinement of other fields.

### Introduction

Technicians will use this option to punch in each day and throughout the day to
punch out as they change to a different activity, which may be work on a different
work order, lunch, etc. Time Clock automatically calculates the time that has
elapsed since the previous entry. If the Thermo King dealer OPT (X63B-6) is on,
Job code fields are included on the detail screen. Thermo King dealers are
encouraged to use Time Clock instead of Technician Time Card Entry.

= Sales Code. If, in the customer's master record, the Int/War field is blank, the
customer sales code default is used; if "I," the internal sales code default is
used; if "W,” the warranty sales code default is used. For customer addresses
that are Internal or Warranty (Int/Warr="I" or "W" in Receivables
Maintenance (X1 1-2), the YW field may be blank, in which case
corresponding addresses are not required on the Point of Sale document.
Individual lines are not marked "I" or "W" on the document; therefore,
separate Internal and Warranty documents are not generated.

= I/W field. If “Default for lines on war docs" is blank, the I/W field on the
Time Clock screen will be blank; if it is "W," the I/W field on the Time Clock
screen will be "W." Any time the //W field is "I" or "W," the corresponding
address numbers must be present on the Sold To screen of the Point of Sale
document.

= Changing. Both fields can be changed on the Time Clock screen.


8 X5.11-1 © TIME CLOCK RELEASE 2.2

- Status Code Billing. If a status code with a billing code of "I" or "W" is
selected, the I/W flag will be changed to match it automatically, and the
corresponding Internal or Warranty address is required to be on the Point of
Sale document (Sold To screen). Labor lines will be entered as "I" and "W”
lines on the document.

= Document Opened to a Unit. The default internal sales code from Time
Clock Configuration is used.

= Document Opened to Internal or Warranty Customer. If the customer is a
warranty or internal customer (Int/War field on the customer's master record.
in Receivables Maintenance has a value of "I" or "W"), system addresses are
not required on the Sold To screen unless the I/W field in Time Clock is set to
'T" or "W."

= Thermo King Warranty Documents. Even if the Point of Sale document is a
Thermo King warranty document, which is indicated by setting the TK field
on the Sold To screen to "I", system addresses are required on the Sold To
screen in order to mark lines as internal or warranty.

Multiple Punches to the Same Job Code

Thermo King’s flat rate is intended to apply to the entire work order, regardless of
how many times it is necessary to use the same job code when the work is done
over several days. For each new entry, Time Clock searches the work order for
other occurrences of the same job code. Then the billed hours of each line are
adjusted so the total billed hours exactly equal the flat rate for the job code. The


POINT OF SALE X5.11-1 © TIME CLOCK 18

calculation uses each line’s reported hours and assigns billed hours based on its
percentage of total reported hours.

Multiple Job Codes

Sometimes job codes cover very small tasks, and it is inefficient to punch out for
each one; for example, a task may actually be made up of several individual steps,
each with its own job code, but it is impossible to separate them into their own
time segments. In this case, Time Clock Entry (X5.11-1) allows up to 5 job codes
per punch.

There is no way for Time Clock to “know” how many job codes you want to
combine; therefore, it is necessary to “reserve” the lines. To indicate that there
will be 5 job codes, enter a character on each line, as illustrated below.

After the punch-out process is complete, Time Clock must assign hours reported
to each job code. The assumption is that the job code with the largest number of
billed hours should have the largest number of reported hours. The flat rates of all
job codes are added and each job code is assigned a percentage based on the total
elapsed time. Then Time Clock checks the work order. If it finds the same job
codes already on the work order, billed hours are adjusted so the total billed hours
exactly equal the flat rate for the job code. The calculation uses each line’s
reported hours and assigns billed hours based on its percentage of total reported
hours.

Muitiple Job Codes with Overtime

When a technician punches out using multiple job codes after the end of their
normal day, Time Clock records regular time first, then uses overtime on the last
job code. Billed hours are allocated as described in the previous section, Multiple
Job Codes.

 

 

NOTE


18 X5.11-1 ¢ TIME CLOCK RELEASE 2.2

Since the last job code may not always be the best one to use for overtime, the
service manager should be alert to the possibility that adjustments need to be
made for this situation.

## CHAPTER X5-10

TECHNICIAN TIME CARD ENTRY

### Introduction

Technician Time Card Entry (TTCE) is a modified program from Time Clock
(Review by Technician). This program can be used as a punch-out system (just
like Time Clock); however, its purpose is not to account for every minute of a
technician’s time. The purpose of Technician Time Card Entry is to record

 

 

 
  
 

billable hours.

### Overview

Labor lines added in TTCE update Point of Sale documents immediately, and
lines can be changed as long as you don’t end the job. The price for this is that
there is no provision for deleting a batch; rather, lines must be deleted
individually. After the job is ended, existing labor lines can be modified only on
the work order. New labor lines can be entered in Technician Time Card Entry or
at Point of Sale. With Time Clock, on the other hand, labor lines cannot be added
or modified at Point of Sale.

An Options window, which can be displayed at the beginning of each session,
retains Time Card settings.

If a batch ends abnormally, simply re-select the Time Card option (X5-10) and
the previously entered data will be recovered automatically. See Automatic
Recovery on page 17.

 

### Warning!

Technician Time Card Entry will always assign the maximum billable hours to (
a job code every time it is used; therefore, on the work order, you may find the
job has been over-billed and will have to be adjusted.

 

 

Technician Time Card Entry has no reporting capability of its own, but the Labor
Analysis Report can be used to check technicians’ hours. It is not connected with

Technician Time Card Entry and Time Clock are mutually exclusive; that is, if
Time Clock has been installed, Technician Time Card Entry is not available and
vice versa.

If the Thermo King dealer OPT (X63B-6) is on, Thermo King job codes are
available and work the same as in Point of Sale. Because of its enhanced features
and reporting ability, Thermo King dealers are encouraged to use Time Clock
instead of Technician Time Card Entry.

C1 Type a valid employee address number. Since it doesn’t use profiles to record
employees’ rates, normal start/stop times, etc., Technician Time Card Entry
accepts employees and technicians. An employee is any system address in the
master file with an edit code of “E” in 3rd position and a technician has a “T”
in the 8th position. Just as in Time Clock, there is no index feature for
technicians’ IDs.

Cmd11-Options

You can change the way the system rounds. In Point of Sale, you’re allowed only
2 decimals (hundredths); however, in Time Card, you can round time to whole
hours, or to the nearest tenth, quarter, or hundredth of an hour plus 10 min. (1), 30
min. (3), and 5 min. (5). It is not necessary to select the rounding method each
time—the method you select will remain as the default until you change it again.
If lines have already been entered when you change the rounding method, they
will not be re-edited and re-rounded until you bring them down to the detail line.

 

### Notice

DIS recommends that you select a rounding option before entering any lines and
stick with it. Although it’s possible to change the way rounding is done, even
mid-session, it is not a good idea. Changing rounding methods may confuse the
customers and make the resulting work orders and reports difficult to reconcile.

 

O To change rounding, press Cmd11-Options. The rounding options are
presented in the following window: (

Since the purpose of Time Card is to record billable hours, you can use start/stop
times instead of punch-out times (you can mix punch-out times and start/stop
times).

On the first line, you can use a punch-in time by typing “IN” in the work order
field.

On the first line that is not a punch-in line, the following information is required:

- Work Order #

= Start/Stop times. If this is the first line or the first line following a punch-in,
both start and stop times are required; otherwise, the system can calculate

» One claim per work order

» Each claim can contain multiple segments (one segment only for a “Service

» One cause of failure (COF) per segment

Up to 27 part lines per segment (one part line only for a “Service Parts Only

Claim”)

Up to 9 Misc. parts per claim

Up to 10 comment lines per claim

Up to 18 serialized parts per claim

No labor lines on “Service Parts Only Claims”

vrvr y


X5-10 ¢ TECHNICIAN TIME CARD ENTRY. RELEASE 2.3

Note that the restriction of only 14 job codes per claim has been removed. You
may need to combine job codes on the work order because the restriction still
applies for Thermo Komm. Adjusting the job codes on the work order is also
necessary because Technician Time Card Entry will always assign the
maximum billable hours to a job code every time it is used; therefore, on the
work order, you may find the job has been over-billed.

The expectation is that you will be using job codes; therefore, you'll go into
“lookup” mode when you press [Enter] on the Time Card Entry screen. If TK
Warr=T on the work order and I/W=W on the labor line, a job code is
required.

To skip a job code, the following conditions must be true:
1) TK Warr=blank on the work order
2) No job code is entered

3) Billed hours are entered

Also, if you don’t want to use a job code, you can press F3=Exit after you enter
the series of Thermo King related screens.

  

Reminder
The "TK Warr" flag on the Sold To screen at Point of Sale cannot be changed if
there is a warranty line on the work order.

SERVICE MANAGEMENT MENU
FOR FLEET MANAGEMENT

### Introduction

The Service Management System (SMS) is an additional product, which is
available for purchase. With it, you can create service work orders and
automatically record and track detailed service history for each unit. You can
store standard jobs, with parts, labor, and description, ready to add to a customer's
service work order as a complete job. In the most advanced usage, the system will
compare the service history of a unit to the recommended service table, and
recommend tasks that should be performed. You may then add other jobs to the
list to be performed, all of which are recorded in detail, to the unit service history.

Fleet Management is compatible with the Truck/Van Inventory Additional
Product. Its primary focus is the management of scheduled maintenance for
customers who own fleets of equipment located at different sites. Fleet
Management makes it possible to schedule maintenance by date or hourmeter and
to charge against a pre-established contract for maintenance. .

 

NOTE
L Unique serial numbers are required for both SMS and Fleet Management.

### Service Management System Features

Your Service Management System is fully integrated with Point of Sale, Parts,
Accounts Receivable and the General Ledger. SMS provides 2 sessions at Point
of Sale. A command key toggles back and forth between 2 documents.

At Point of Sale, the following types of documents (modes) are available, all
with the same "look and feel":
— Active documents (work orders)
— Standard jobs
— History documents, including:
a) Closed & posted work orders with serial numbers (former active
documents)
b) Documents created expressly for history records, created at POS in
"History documents" mode

Standard jobs

Standard jobs can be created directly or copied from work orders and
accumulated over time. Standard jobs, each identified as a Group:Job, can be
added to Service Tables and Recommended Maintenance. As the Group:Job
identifier is expanded to its actual detail lines on a work order, the usual
checks are made for special pricing, supersession, availability, etc. (same as
Copy-Lines).

Labor lines shortcut

When a standard job is used on a work order, a job code entered on the POS
Entrance screen takes you directly to a labor line on the detail screen. From
there you can add labor and other types of lines, and then close the work
order.

Customer's unit number

You can use the customer's unit number to locate the unit more quickly at
POS or Inquire/Update Service Units. It is also printed on the work order.
Series code

Equipment can be identified by a 3-characier series code, which may often be
more helpful than organizing service tables strictly by make/model and year.
Reports on the Service Reports Menu can be displayed on screen or printed.
Equipment searches by:

— Customer name

License number

Unit number

Serial number (same as VIN). Must be unique.

— Customer's unit number

Service history tracking including all work performed on equipment. Detail
can be preserved as long as you need it (or disk space permits), then collapsed
in stages.

Equipment is automatically added to the service system when it is sold.


4 X10 « SERVICE MANAGEMENT MENU FOR FLEET MANAGEMENT RELEASE 10.1

= Recommended service maintenance displays:

### Fleet Management Features

The Fleet Management System was designed with the following objectives in
mind:

= Easy access to ship to location information, unit information, and unit history
from Point of Sale.

= Improved efficiency for dispatcher to obtain a monthly customer list for
customers on Schedule Maintenance.

® Quick access to unit history for parts installed on a specific unit for warranty.

= Capture of unit repair cost for marketing service, parts, new equipment sales.

" Marketing analysis of unit population by age, cost of repair, etc. for service,

 

parts, and sales.
NOTICE
As in Service Management, unique serial numbers are required for Fleet
Management.

 

Very briefly, the enhancements made to the Service Management System for
Fleet Management include:

= On Point of Sale work orders, all users are warned when a part is still on
warranty for any unit that has been set up in Fleet Management. A pop-up
window allows you to change the billing to Internal (I) or Warranty (W). After
a part line is changed to Warranty, subsequent lines default to "W," which is

and includes relevant dates and records pertaining to the unit's service
contract and schedule. Units can be associated with existing contracts,
which are entered in Inquire/Update Service Contracts (X10.3-20). A
Scheduled Maintenance Summary report (X10.2-8) and Scheduled

Maintenance List (X10.2.9) can be printed for a specific (or all) contract

= Point of Sale Enhancements
— Anew field on the Sold To screen at Point of Sale records a "Work Date,"
from which the date of the next scheduled maintenance is calculated. In
addition, function keys provide access to notes, a record of parts installed
on the unit, and costs associated with the unit.
— The command key [F16] to scroll through units has been enhanced so that
you can select from a list instead of scrolling through the customer’s units.

Parts and costs for the current owner and previous owners provide a

complete history. In addition, the system keeps track of the date parts are
installed and their warranty period.

= Each customer address may have multiple Ship To addresses associated with
it. Units within the fleet may be assigned to different Ship To addresses,
which correspond to their locations. The initial conversion process establishes
each customer address as a Ship To address for itself. As new addresses are
entered, this process must be done manually.

1. Inquire/Update Service Tables

A service table is an intermediate device that combines standard jobs (the
Group:Job created at Point of Sale) before they can be assigned to a particular
Make/Model and available for automatic inclusion in recommended
maintenance. The most straightforward technique is to name your tables the same
as your groups, although this is not required.

 

Group: Jobs can be deleted from recommended maintenance, and other
Group:Jobs can be added; however, service tables make it possible to make sure
jobs are added accurately and on schedule.

 

 

2. Inquire/Update Make Model Assignments

Use this job to assign vehicles to service tables according to make, model, year or
range of years (or series codes). This is necessary to enable the system to furnish
jobs for recommended maintenance automatically.

3. Service Note Distribution

Use Service Note Distribution to distribute notes, such as special programs or
tecall notices, to a range of units.

4. Standard Job Rename

Use this job if you want to rename the 6-character job code. All associated
information is transferred to the new job code.


X10 ¢ SERVICE MANAGEMENT MENU FOR FLEET MANAGEMENT a

5, Serial Number Rename

Use this job if you want to change a unit's serial number or VIN. All associated
information is transferred to the new serial number or VIN (Vehicle Identification
Number)

6. Service Divisional Profile

This is a one-time setup job where defaults are established for other Service
Management jobs.

7. Update Standard Job Parts Prices

Use this option after a price update to change the prices of parts on standard jobs
according to the new prices in inventory for all standard jobs in a group.

8. Update Labor Rate for a Group

Use this option to change the labor rates on standard jobs. Updates are done for all
standard jobs in a group.

9. Delete a Standard Job
Use this option to delete a standard job from a group.

10. Load Manufacturer Standard Jobs
In this chapter, you'll learn how to load manufacturer standard jobs and how to
use them at Point of Sale. In addition, you'll learn how to change standard jobs;

however, changes are lost the next time you take this option to load manufacturer
standard jobs.

11. Correct Service History

Use this option to make corrections to serial numbers that have been entered by
mistake. Usually these are typographical errors that cause variations of a serial
number to be set up as separate units. For example, serial number
2P4FH5531LR621529 may also be entered as 2P4FH5531LR621528 and
2P4FH5531LR621592. You can use this job to eliminate the incorrect serial
numbers and combine service history records under the correct serial number.

12. Maintain Service Options

Use this job to enter a table of service option codes and their descriptions. The
codes may be up to 8 characters each; the descriptions, 30 characters. To print the
list of options, press F21=Print on the Maintain Service Options screen, or select
option 11, Options File List, from the Service Reports Menu (X10-2).

One service option can be associated with a unit on the Edit Unit Service
Information screen, which is illustrated below. This screen is accessed from the
Inquire/Update Service Units screen by pressing Cmd10-Unit Service Info, then


X10 * SERVICE MANAGEMENT MENU FOR FLEET MANAGEMENT RELEASE 70.1

F6=Edit. Service options are user-defined and may pertain to any aspect of
scheduled maintenance.

13. Maintain Parts Warranty

Use this option to specify the default number of days that parts are warrantied and
to maintain a list of parts with warranty periods that are different. To print the list
of parts, press F21=Print on the Maintain Parts Warranty screen, or select option
12, Warranties File List, from the Service Reports Menu (X10-2).

14. Purge Repair Parts History

Use this option to delete parts history through a selected date. This pertains only
to a customer’s unit repair history and the parts that have been installed on the
unit for the current and previous owners. It does not apply to Part Sales History

(X5-7).

15. Purge Unit Repair Cost History

Use this option to delete unit cost records through a selected date. A unit’s repair
cost for the current owner or all owners can be reviewed and printed by pressing
F16=Costs on the Unit Service Information screen.

16. Maintain Ship To Location

Use this option to associate multiple "Ship to" addresses with a customer's
address, During the file conversion that accompanied this enhancement, all
customers were assigned their own address as a "Ship to." Additional assignments
for current customers and new customers must be made manually.

17. Maintain Unit Service Info

Use this option when you need to enter contracts for a lot of units at once and
want a more direct path to the Edit Unit Service Information screen, especially
during initial setup for Ship To Location Info and Unit History enhancement.

18. Assign Units to Ship to Location

Use this job to change a unit to a different Ship To location from the original
owner. Before a Ship To address can be assigned to a unit in this job, it must be
associated with the customer's address in Service Information Maintenance
(X10.3-16). The conversion process assigns each customer address to itself;
however, future additions must be assigned manually. There is no limit to the
number of “Ship To” addresses that can be assigned to the same “Sold To”
customer (owner) address#.

 

### Warning!

All customers must have their own address as a Ship To address, regardless of
whether any units are assigned to it.


X10 » SERVICE MANAGEMENT MENU FOR FLEET MANAGEMENT 13

 

19. Maintain Hourmeter

The purpose of this option is to enable you to reset hourmeter readings on all units
at a particular “Ship to” location at the same time. From the same screen, you can
investigate cost, maintain notes, review parts, or display the Unit Service
Information screen.

20. Inquire/Update Service Contracts

Use this option to record details about service contracts including the contract
number, a customer address number, which could be a billing or ship to address, a
short description, and terms. Thermo King dealers should use the customer
address number field for a billing address.

After a contract is entered, one or more units can be associated with it on the Unit
Service Info screen in Inquire/Update Service Units. Each unit can be associated
with only one contract.

### Overview Of Service Management

The steps involved in successful Service Management are:

1) Create standard jobs at Point of Sale. When you select Standard Jobs mode,
the address number used on the entrance screen is the group name and the
document number you assign is the job name. Every standard job can then be
referred to as a Group:Job.

2) Assign Group:Jobs to tables, usually with the same names as the groups
(Inquire/Update Service Tables, X10.3-1).

3) Link equipment to tables according to make, model, years or series code.
(Inquire/Update Make Model Assignments, X10.3-2).

Tables of Group:Job combinations are automatically included in recommended
maintenance, which is available from Inquire/Update Service Units (X10-1) or
from Point of Sale (X5-1, [Cmd18}).

Please refer to the SMS Diagrams, which precede this chapter and illustrate the
integration of SMS and Point of Sale. In particular, see diagram #2, How to
Use Standard Jobs.

### Overview Of Fleet Management

Most features in Fleet Management are concentrated within Inquire/Update
Service Units (X10-1) and can be handled on a case-by-case basis. There are
shortcuts on the Service Utilities Menu, and these will be pointed out but not
illustrated in this section.

To illustrate the features, we'll follow an example of a customer, Coleman
Forklift Corp., who has a fleet of 6 forklifts. The concepts can be illustrated in a
table, which will expand. Let’s start with the owner and the 6 forklifts.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By pressing Cmd8-Unit Index at the Inquire/Update Service Units entrance
screen, you can see the units listed by serial number.

Coleman Forklift’s units were not purchased from the dealership; they were
entered in Service Management by serial number.

Since Coleman Forklift Corp. owns the fleet, it is billed for repairs; therefore, at
Point of Sale, Coleman will always be the “Sold To” address. Associated with the
billing address may be many “Ship To” addresses, which represent the various
locations of the customer’s units. The “Ship To” addresses may be any valid DIS
system address, they can be set up in Address Maintenance (X4-2) or on the fly.
The 6 Coleman forklifts are located in 3 different warehouses: 2 at Minharo
Wholesale in Burlington, 2 in Anacortes, and 2 in Sedro Wooley. To handle the 3
locations, 3 “Ship To” addresses are needed.

Two associations are needed:
"The “Ship To” addresses must be associated with the “Sold To” address
= Each unit must be associated with a “Ship To” address.

This screen applies to the unit displayed under the address fields, in this case,
F001. This is where the Tecord-keeping is done concerning maintenance dates,
parts installed, and repair costs.

The most recent work date from a SM work order is stored as “SM Previous” on
the Unit Service Information screen. “SM Due” is calculated by adding
“Frequency” to the most recent work date.

After maintenance schedules have been entered, the table is nearly complete. All
that remains is for the system to track parts and costs, which are recorded on the

Scheduled Maintenance Due Report

After the initial setup work has been done, the service manager will run the
Scheduled Maintenance Due Report to see which units need to be serviced in the
next month. From this report, a plan can be developed whereby all units in the
same geographical area can be scheduled and the service manager can determine
how many technician hours will be required.

Point of Sale Work Orders

At Point of Sale, a work order is opened to the “Sold To” address, in this case,

Warranty Parts

On Point of Sale work orders, all users are warned when a part is still on warranty
for any unit that has been set up in Fleet Management. The warranty period for a
part is set up in Maintain Parts Warranty (X10.3-13). A pop-up window allows
you to change the billing to Internal (1) or Warranty (W). The default is blank,
which means the customer will be billed.

### Warning!

   

The code combines both S/36 and AS/400 conventions, which handle decimal
places differently. On $/36 screens, decimal places are assumed: they are not
entered on the screen. On AS/400 screens, decimals are entered directly into
fields. If you enter 3600 on an AS/400 screen, the system records 3600.00.

When you deal with numbers with decimal places, look for the screen name in the
upper right comer. 8/36 screens are numbered according to the menu map and
include the option number, such as X51000-106. AS/400 screen names are 7-
character combinations of letters and numbers, such as VSMAEIR, which don't
mean much to most of us.

 

 

In addition, $/36 screens refer to command keys, such as Cmd1-End job, while
AS/400 screens refer to function keys, such as F3=Exit. On all AS/400 screens,
press F3=Exit to end the job and return to a menu. If you just want to go back one
screen, press F12=Previous.

Notes:

## CHAPTER X5-10

TECHNICIANS TIME CARD ENTRY

### Introduction

Technician Time Card Entry (TTCE) is a modified program from Time Clock
(Review by Technician). It requires no setup and retains no permanent
information other than what is recorded on the Point of Sale documents. Labor
lines added in TTCE update Point of Sale documents immediately, and lines can
be changed as long as you don’t end the job. The price for this is that there is no
provision for deleting a batch; rather, lines must be deleted individually. After the
job is ended, existing labor lines can be modified only on the work order. New
labor lines can be entered in Technician Time Card Entry or at Point of Sale. With
Time Clock, on the other hand, labor lines cannot be added at Point of Sale.

   
   
     

 

### Warning!

Technician Time Card Entry will always assign the maximum billable hours to
a job code every time it is used; therefore, on the work order, you may find the
job has been over-billed and will have to be adjusted.

Technician Time Card Entry has no reporting capability of its own, but the Labor
Analysis Report can be used to check technicians” hours. It is not connected with

Technician Time Card Entry and Time Clock are mutually exclusive; that is, if
Time Clock has been installed, Technicians Time Card Entry is not available and
vice versa.

If the Thermo King dealer OPT (X63B-6) is on, Thermo King job codes are
available and work the same as in Point of Sale. Because of its enhanced features
and reporting ability, Thermo King dealers are encouraged to use Time Clock
instead of Technician Time Card Entry.

change technicians or dates, simply return to the entrance screen, illustrated
below.

you press [Enter] on a detail line; therefore, the
information is available and can be changed on the work
order after you end this job.

  

 

C1 Type a valid employee address number. Since it doesn’t use profiles to record
employees’ rates, normal start/stop times, etc., Technician Time Card Entry
accepts any employee as a technician. An employee is any system address in
the master file with an “E” in 3rd position of Edit Code field. Just as in Time
Clock, there is no index feature for technicians’ IDs.

Cmd11-Change Rounding

As in the previous release of Technician Time Card Entry, you can change the
way the system rounds. In Point of Sale, you’re allowed only 2 decimals
(hundredths); however, in Time Card, you can round time to whole hours, or to
the nearest tenth, quarter, or hundredth of an hour (rounding options 1/2, 1/6, and
1/12 are no longer offered). It is not necessary to select the rounding method each
time—the method you select will remain as the default until you change it again.
If lines have already been entered when you change the rounding method, they
will not be re-edited and re-rounded until you bring them down to the detail line.

   
 

 
 

### Notice

DIS recommends that you select a rounding option before entering any lines and
stick with it. Although it’s possible to change the way rounding is done, even
mid-session, it is not a good idea. Changing rounding methods may confuse the
customers and make the resulting work orders and reports difficult to reconcile.

This program can be used as a punch-out system (just like Time Clock); however,
its purpose is not to account for every minute of a technician’s time. The purpose
of Technician Time Card Entry is to record billable hours; therefore, you can use
start/stop times instead of punch-out times (you can mix punch-out times and
start/stop times).

Because there is no setup or configuration for this job (no stored values), all
relevant information is required on the first detail line. These values are then
stored in temporary files and used as defaults for subsequent lines and retrieved
when you need to change lines. When you press [Cmd1] to end the job, the
temporary files are deleted.

the system will calculate reported and billed hours
from the previous stop time.

Technician Time Card Entry follows the same specifications and limits for
creating Thermo King warranty claims as in Point of Sale Invoicing, which are:
> One claim per work order
» Each claim can contain multiple segments (one segment only for a “Service
Parts Only Claim”)
» One cause of failure (COF) per segment
> Upto 27 part lines per segment (one part line only for a “Service Parts Only
Claim”)
Up to 9 Misc. parts per claim
Up to 3 outside invoices per claim

> Upto 10 comment lines per claim
> Upto 18 serialized parts per claim
» No labor lines on “Service Parts Only Claims”

Note that the restriction of only 14 job codes per claim has been removed. You
may need to combine job codes on the work order because the restriction still
applies for Thermo Komm. Adjusting the job codes on the work order is also
necessary because Technician Time Card Entry will always assign the
maximum billable hours to a job code every time it is used; therefore, on the
work order, you may find the job has been over-billed.

The expectation is that you will be using job codes; therefore, you’ ll go into
“Jookup” mode when you press [Enter] on the Time Card Entry screen. If TK
Warr=T on the work order and Bill=W on the labor line, a job code is
required.

To skip a job code, the following conditions must be true:
1) TK Warr=blank on the work order
2) No job code is entered

3) Billed hours are entered

Also, if you don’t want to use a job code, you can press F3=Exit after you enter
the series of Thermo King related screens.

 

Reminder
The "TK Warr" flag on the Sold To screen at Point of Sale cannot be changed if
there is a warranty line on the work order.

## CHAPTER X5-9

SELF SERVICE INVOICING

### Introduction

Self Service Invoicing enables customers with minimal knowledge of
Point of Sale Invoicing to create invoices. All sales are charge.

This job is designed to work closely with bar coding. You may want to
make up a card for each self service customer and print the customer's
receivable address as a bar code. In addition, each part can be labeled with
a bar code, which is one of its cross-references. The system uses the cross-
reference to find the vendor code and manufacturer's part number. The
cross-reference number is set up with a forced rob--obviously the part is
available if its bar code is being wanded. (Forced rob is an option when
the bar coding option is installed.)

Call DIS if you're interested in using bar coding at Point of Sale. A label
can be printed with the bar code that includes the vendor code and part
number.

Self Service Invoicing uses the normal Point of Sale program; however,
the screen looks different to the customer because most fields are hidden.
To limit the amount of information needed by the customer, Self Service
Invoicing relies on the following defaults:

 

 

 

Document Classification Code
0 Parts Sales Code (format "P")
QO Unique Point of Sale ID (not used for standard invoicing)

 

Except for the POS ID, you could use codes that are already in use;
however, you'll probably want to track self service sales better by setting
up new document and sales codes, which are identified in Self Service
Invoicing Defaults (X52-11).

### Introduction

Use this job to change a unit to a different Ship To location from the original
owner. Before a Ship To address can be assigned to a unit in this job, it must be
associated with the customer's address in Maintain Ship To Location (X10.3-16).
The conversion process assigns each customer address to itself; however, future
additions must be assigned manually. There is no limit to the number of “Ship
To” addresses that can be assigned to the same “Sold To” customer (owner)

Use this option to associate multiple "Ship to" addresses with a customer's
address. During the file conversion that accompanied this enhancement, all
customers were assigned their own address as a "Ship to." Additional assignments
for current customers and new customers must be made manually.

In Fleet Management, the customer is the billing address and the “Ship To”
address is where the unit is physically located. “Ship To” is not the same as a
contact. A contact is simply a record of one or more persons who can be
contacted in regard to contracts, maintenance, and units. However, the same name
may be both a “Ship To” and a contact, in which case, it must be set up both here
and in Customer Service Information.

As you may suspect, storing a lot of document detail consumes a lot of
disk space. To help you conserve disk space while, at the same time,
preserving enough information to be helpful, DIS has provided a way for
you to delete some detail. Based on the schedule entered below, history
documents are collapsed during Point of Sale End of Month (X5-4).
Collapsed documents are listed on the Service History Report as
"Summary Documents.”

Collapse history to the document level
Job header lines are deleted; individual document remains intact.

Collapse history to the job code level
Lines with the same sales code format, such as "P" (parts format), are
combined into 1 line and | total. Individual documents remain intact.

Collapse history to the customer/unit level
At this level, documents lose their identity as identical job codes are
combined onto a common document. The remaining summary
documents, lacking detail, indicate only jobs done and totals spent.

eliminate the incorrect serial numbers and combine service history records
under the correct serial number.

During Correct Service History, no parts or point of sale jobs should be
running. In addition, the Point of Sale Print program (DISPSPPnu) must
be ended by running backup, Point of Sale End of Month, or manually

## CHAPTER X10.3-10

LOAD MANUFACTURER STANDARD JOBS

### Introduction

In this chapter, you'll learn how to load manufacturer standard jobs and how to
use them at Point of Sale. In addition, you'll learn how to change standard jobs
and how to prevent their being overwritten during an update. After standard jobs
have been loaded, a Standard Job Exception Report lists the jobs that you have
specified for no update.

Standard jobs are available in Inquire/Update Units (X10-1) in Recommended
Maintenance, and they are displayed in Service History. Descriptions of job codes
on labor lines are listed on the Standard Jobs Report (X10.2-3) and Service
History Report (X10.2-4).

You can change standard jobs in Point of Sale in Standard Jobs mode. You can
access standard jobs in Active Document mode from the detail line by using
Copy-Lines [F20].

Case Standard Jobs

Over 500 Case model numbers are used as group codes, and they are added to the
master file as cash customers; therefore, they will not appear in the Point of Sale
index unless you track cash customers. As of October 1999, there were about
228,485 standard jobs for Case Agriculture and 88,503 for Case Construction
Equipment.

Thermo King Standard Jobs

Thermo King standard jobs are uploaded from Thermo Komm automatically
according to the schedule specified in Set Time for Daily TKOMM Updates
(X7.14-10), or you can use Get Updates from TKOMM Immediately (X7.14-11).
Because the labor hours vary by model number, you will need to remember that
the group code will be *TKJOB, the job code will be TK job code (5 characters)
with the model number suffixed (3 characters).

SETUP

During the loading process, you will be asked for setup information, which
includes:

1. The document type you use for Service Management.

2. Cross-references for sales codes. Your sales codes must be of the same format
as the sales codes on the tape.

3. Cross-references for vendor codes. Your 3-character vendor codes for Case
and Allied will be required.

4. Default tax and discount codes for:
Part lines
Labor lines
Miscellaneous quantity lines
Miscellaneous description lines

5. Updates to flat rate mark-up factors, if applicable. Since only flat rates are
provided with the job codes furnished by Case Corporation, there are no labor
rates unless you add them to the standard jobs.

After the initial load, subsequent updates to standard jobs will print a list of
standard jobs that you don’t want updated automatically because of changes you
have made. You can use the list to decide whether you need to update the part
prices manually.

To be better prepared for the questions, take a look at the screens, which are
illustrated in this chapter, before you begin. To print the standard jobs after they

INQUIRE/UPDATE MAKE MODEL ASSIGNMENTS

### Introduction

Use this job to assign vehicles to service tables according to make, model,
year or range of years (or series codes). This is necessary to enable the
system to furnish jobs for recommended maintenance automatically.

The steps are:

 

C1 Create standard jobs at Point of Sale. When you select Standard Jobs
mode, the address number used on the entrance screen is the group
name and the document number you assign is the job name. Every
standard job can then be referred to as a Group:Job.

C1 Assign Group:Jobs to tables, usually with the same names as the groups
(Inquire/Update Service Tables, X10.3-1).

 

 

Link equipment to tables according to make, model, years or series
(nquire/Update Make Model Assignments, X10.3-2).

 

 

 

 

Tables of Group:Job combinations are automatically included in
recommended maintenance, which is available from Inquire/Update
Service Units (X10-1) or from Point of Sale (X5-1, [Cmd18]).

For more information, see CHAPTERS X10 and X10.3-1, SERVICE
MANAGEMENT MENU and INQUIRE/UPDATE SERVICE TABLES,
and CHAPTER X5-1, POINT OF SALE INVOICING.

Equipment can be assigned to service tables in the following ways (a
series code may be used instead of year):

= Specific make, model and year (or range of years or series).
Example: Ford 7610 '83-'87.

= Make and model are given with no year (or series). Example: Ford
7610 (leave year/series blank to indicate all years/series of New
Holland 680).


[| X10.3-2 INQUIRE/UPDATE MAKE MODEL ASSIGNMENTS _

= Make and year (range of years or series) with no model. Example:

Ford '64-'68 (leave model blank to indicate all models of Ford
vehicles from 1964 through 1968).

Make is specified with no model or years (or series). Example:
New Holland (model and year/series are blank to indicate all
models and years/series of New Holland vehicles)

When you want to display the recommended maintenance for a particular
piece of equipment, the program does the following to determine which
service table to use:


Oo

 

 

 

 

First, it tries to find the actual make, model and year (or series) of
the equipment. If that fails,

It tries to find the make and model (with a blank year and series). If (
that fails,

It tries to find the make and year (with a blank model and series). If
that fails,

It tries to find the make (with blank model and year and series). If

INQUIRE/UPDATE SERVICE TABLES

### Introduction

A service table is an intermediate device that combines standard jobs (the
Group:Job created at Point of Sale) before they can be assigned to a
particular Make/Model and available for automatic inclusion in
recommended maintenance. The most straightforward technique is to
name your tables the same as your groups, although this is not required.

Group:Jobs can be deleted from recommended maintenance, and other
Group:Jobs can be added; however, service tables make it possible to
make sure jobs are added accurately and on schedule.

The steps are:

O Create standard jobs at Point of Sale. When you select Standard Jobs
mode, the address number used on the entrance screen is the group
name and the document number you assign is the job name. Every
standard job can then be referred to as a Group:Job.

 

Assign Group:Jobs to tables, usually with the same names as the groups
Cnquire/Update Service Tables, X10.3-1).

 

 

 

 

Link equipment to tables according to make, model, years or series
code. (Inquire/Update Make Model Assignments, X10.3-2).

 

U1 Tables of Group:Job combinations are automatically included in
recommended maintenance, which is available from Inquire/Update
Service Units (X10-1) or from Point of Sale (X5-1, [Cmd18]).

For more information, see CHAPTERS X10 and X10.3-2, SERVICE

“@" "#" can be used. Do NOT use the following characters: "" (blank)

"\" (comma), "*" (asterisk), "/" (forward slash), "-" (dash or minus sign), (
"+" (plus sign), ">" (greater than sign), "=" (equal sign), or "?" (question
mark).

A digit is any number from 0-9. Example: 5.2 D digits means S digits

### Copying A Service Table

You may have different types of equipment that require almost the same
maintenance. For example, tractors may have the same service schedule as
backhoes with the exception of Oil and Filter change intervals. Rather than
type a new table for tractors, copy the codes from the tractor table to the
backhoe table. Then customize the new backhoe table to fit the needs of
backhoes.

Type "C" next to the name of the table you want to copy at the list of
Current Service Tables on the Inquire/Update Service Tables screen. The
following screen appears:

### Setting Up A Default Table

Sometimes a customer brings in a piece of equipment that you do not sell
or usually service. This vehicle may not match any make, model, or year
assignments in the service tables. But, it would be nice to be able to show
some kind of recommended maintenance schedule to the customer.

Think of the default service table as a "catch-all" which will be used when
no others match. The information in the default table will be general
maintenance guidelines that apply to most equipment.

To create the default table, place an X next to "default" in the table list.
Press [Enter]. Fill in the fields on the default service table.

### Restoring Data Files

It may be necessary to restore your data files from a backup when your
system has encountered an unrecoverable error. Please consult with the
Response Line to determine if this is the best solution for you.

When this procedure is performed, all of the data that is currently on your
system is replaced with data that was on your system before the error
occurred. The critical elements of this procedure are a current backup of
your data files and an exact audit trail to help you recover to the current
day and time.

O First, find your most current backup. It is a good idea to CATALOG it
to make sure your backup files are complete.

G If you have an AS/400 with a tape backup, find the last backup tape
created before the error occurred. Put that tape in the drive and type:
DSPTAP and press [Cmd4]. The following screen appears.

X10-1 ¢ INQUIRE/UPDATE SERVICE UNITS FOR FLEET MANAGEMENT §

From this screen you can select a particular piece of equipment and/or see each
piece of equipment for a given customer. The selection of equipment depends
upon which ficld you enter or change. The screen is processed from top to bottom
(i.e. Address #, Name, License #, Serial #, Unit# , C Unit #). The first field that
has been changed to a new value will be used to find the piece of equipment.

Tips

When a unit is traded, sold, exchanged, or transferred, it can easily be reassigned
to a different customer. Simply display the current owner's record for the unit,
type over the customer address number, and press [Enter].

[When a customer changes their C Unit# and assigns it to a different unit, it can be
changed on the View/Update screen by replacing the current C Unit#. If the new
C Unit# is already assigned to a unit, you'll need to remove it from the first unit
before reassigning it, because the same customer cannot use a C Unit# more than
once. However, the same C Unit# can be used by different customers.

 

C1 Fill in the fields, and press [Enter] to update the information and return to the
top part of screen. If [Enter] is not pressed, the fields will not be updated. You
may change the equipment information displayed on the screen.

These updates remain in Service Management. The records in Inquire/Update
Units will not be affected. This allows you to maintain the integrity of the
washout tree and Sold Units report yet transfer equipment if it is resold to a
new customer.

"Drop In" Equipment - Not on File

If it's a "drop-in" unit you have never serviced, you may not have a recommended
maintenance schedule set up for the exact make, model and year. There are
different ways equipment can be assigned to service tables:

" Specific make, model and year (or range of years). Example: Ford 7610 '83- .
‘87.

- Make and model are given with no year. Example: New Holland 680 (leave
year blank to indicate all years of model number 680).

- Make and year (or range of years) with no model. Example: Ford '64-'68
(leave mode! blank to indicate all models of Ford equipment from 1964
through 1968). ,

"Make is specified with no model or years. Example: New Holland (model and
year are blank to indicate all models and years of New Holland equipment).

When you want to display the recommended maintenance for a particular piece of
equipment, the program does the following to determine which service table to
use:

1) First, it tries to find the actual make, model and year of the equipment. If that
fails,

2) It tries to find the make and model (with a blank year). If that fails,

3) It tries to find the make and year (with a blank model). If that fails,

4) It tries to find the make (with blank model and year). If that fails,

5) It will use the default service table (refer to Set up Default Table). If no
default table is found,

6) Anerror message is displayed.

 

NOTE
Setting up service tables and assigning equipment to them is discussed in more
detail in CHAPTERS X10.3-1, INQUIRE/UPDATE SERVICE TABLES, and
X10.3-2, INQUIRE/UPDATE MAKE MODEL ASSIGNMENTS.

## CHAPTER X7-22

GENERAL LEDGER DOWNLOAD

### Introduction

The General Ledger Download prepares a file of account numbers, names,
and Year-To-Date (YTD) balances for any G/L month you choose. It uses
familiar Financial Statement screens, which means that you can download
data for a single division or any combination. If you have
departmentalized your general ledger, you can run a download by
department. The download is a standard procedure, which is used in many
of DIS's communications packages.

The download creates an ASCII (text) file, GLD.DIS on the PC, which can
be used with an Excel Spreadsheet. If you ever need Month-To-Date
figures, it will be necessary to download 2 months and subtract account
totals. For example, to calculate what happened in March, it would be
necessary to download figures for February and March and calculate the
difference. Since each download overwrites the GLD.DIS file, it is
necessary to rename the first download, such as GLDmm.DIS, where
"mm" is the month.

### Installation

The screen defaults to the oldest closed month. Select the month by the
calendar year, such as August = 8, September = 9, and October = 10 in the
example above. Figures on the General Ledger Download are based on the
fiscal year-to-date. If your fiscal year begins April 1, and you request a

Sales, Cost of Sales, Income and Expense accounts as
explained in General Ledger (X1-4), you may select the
department by pressing [Cmd2].

Cmd3 Select by division. If you have more than one division and {

Select By Department

We will assume you have departmentalized all Sales, Cost of Sales,
Income and Expense accounts. If you have not or have questions regarding
departmentalization, refer to the section General Ledger (X1-4).

For example, we will say the departments have been defined as:

Department Code
Parts 1
Service 2
Sales 3
Administration 4

When setting up your General Ledger account numbers, the last position
of the account number was reserved for the department code.

Also, we will say our goal was to have each department receive credit for
the sales they made. This will help the shop offset their high expenses for
electricity with income generated by parts sales for equipment they are
working on. See a sample chart below:

SERVICE LABOR ANALYSIS

### Introduction

Service Labor Analysis includes only labor lines that have been placed on
a work order in connection with a standard job. By contrast, the Labor
Analysis Report on the Point of Sale Report Menu (X56-4) includes all
labor lines. Both reports use figures that are available since the last cutoff
date used for Point of Sale End of Month (X5-4).

Service Labor Analysis helps you compare the performance of the
mechanics relative to flat rates, By scanning the column labeled
"Reported" and "% Flat" for percentages greater than 100%, you can spot
times that are consistently more than the flat rate provides for.

### How To Run

From the Service Reports Menu (X10-2), select option 2, Service Labor
Analysis. After the service security gate, the report is placed on the job
queue,

. Return To Manufacturers Menu

Ready for option number or command

Note If the postal code in Security Maintenance (X6-6) is U.S., the menu and
screens show “Farm Plan”; if Canadian, they are labeled “Agline.”

After Farm Plan/Agline transactions have been posted in Point of Sale, you'll use
Transfer/Transmit (X7.15-1) to transfer the batches to Farm Plan/Agline. Posted
Farm Plan transactions are stored in a file called "u.FPA" on the DIS Business
System. The Transfer/Transmit option transfers the file from the AS/400 to the
PC, then calls Farm Plan's Communication program which transmits the
information to Farm Plan. An authorization code is required for a transaction
when the total is $500 or more. This limit is in the software and can be changed
by DIS only. On a single transaction, an authorization code is entered at the time
the point of sale document is closed and is not required in Transfet/Transmit. If
the transaction is entered through Create Source Documents and is $500 or more,
an authorization code will be required in Transfer/Transmit.

In addition, the following configuration step is required:

Farm Plan/Agline Configuration (X7.15-2). Farm Plan assigns information to
the dealership for communications. It is the information that the Farm Plan
computer will be expecting. In the Configuration option, you configure the
computer to match the computer at Farm Plan. You must configure before you
can communicate with Farm Pian. Once the information is entered, do not change
it without consulting DIS or Farm Plan.

### Manufacturers X7-15 * Farm Plan 3

If it is necessary to post Farm Plan/Agline transactions through Create Source
Documents, use FP or AG in the last 2 positions of the debit to the customer’s
account.

Automatic transactions, identified by *AUTO, are generated to reverse the debit
to the customer’s account. On the debit to the customer’s account, the original
document number is placed in the document number and description fields. On
the debit to the credit card account, the original document number is placed in the
document number field. The customer’s address is placed in the description field
with the 2-character code for the Farm Pian (FP) credit card in the last 2 Positions.

### Entering Transactions In Create Source Documents

If necessary, Farm Plan/Agline, credit card sales can be entered through Create
Source Documents. These transactions will be reversed automatically and can be
transmitted to Farm Plan. Since there is no way to associate a credit card number
with a customer in Create Source Documents, you will be asked for the credit
card number at the time the transaction is transmitted.

Make sure that:

= The 2 characters “FP” (or “AG” for Canadian dealers) are in the last 2
positions of the debit to the customer’s account.

= The same document number is used for all lines.

TRANSFER /TRANSMIT

### Introduction

This option is used to transfer batches to Farm Plan/Agline after Farm
Plan/Agline transactions have been posted. An authorization code is required for a
transaction when the total is $500 or more. This limit is in the software and can be
changed by DIS only. On a single transaction, an authorization code is entered at
the time the point of sale document is closed and is not required in
Transfer/Transmit. If the transaction is entered through Create Source Documents
and is $500 or more, an authorization code will be required in Transfer/Transmit.

Posted Farm Plan transactions are stored in a file called "u.FPA” on the DIS
Business System. The Transfer/Transmit option transfers the file from the DIS
Business System to the PC, then calls "CheckF” which transmits the information
to Farm Plan.

You can communicate with Farm Plan 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and as
many times a day as desired.

DO NOT RUN THIS JOB FROM A PC ACTING AS A CONSOLE ON

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION

### Introductio!

Use this option to configure the DIS Electronic Commerce Manager (ECM),
which handles communications on the AS/400. Transfers between the Business
System and another host computer, such as Case, use only ECM. The
configuration for ECM is also applied to Manufacture Parts Locator Download
(X38-8).

For other vendors, transfers are made between the DIS Business System and the

vendor’s software running on a PC. These transfers require 3 components:

= DIS Electronic Commerce Manager (ECM) on the AS/400

= DIS Electronic Commerce Client (ECC) on a PC. Configuration for ECC is
also covered in this chapter.

= Mannfacturer’s Software, such as New Holland DCS, on the same PC as
ECC. The following vendor packages may be installed on the PC:

General Configuration

General configuration is required for all communications that use DIS Electronic
Commerce Client (ECC). In addition, manufacturers other than Farm Plan have
individualized configuration tabs, which are explained in this section.

t G Configuration - DIS Electronic Commerce Client

 

 

CRITICAL STEP.

Use the AS/400
Workstation Name
from page 5
(Windows 3.11) or
page 6 (Windows
95).

 

 

Check AS/400 every minutes

The suggested polling frequency is 10 minutes, which means the PC will look for
data, such as a finalized order or a part locator file, on the AS/400 every 10
minutes, and, if it finds something, transfer it to the designated directory on the
PC’s hard drive. Destination directories are configured within the different
Manufacturer tabs.


10 X6.15-1 « ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION RELEASE 2.3

 

AS/400 Workstation Name

Use the computer name determined on page 6-the PC that will be used for
transfers (where the manufacturer’s communications software, such as AGCO
Solutions On-Line or Clarknet III, is installed, orders and returns will be printed
and closed, and parts locator files wili be created and downloaded). Make sure the
AS/400 Workstation Name is the same as the Workstation Name used on the
Configure Communication Devices screen. See page 30.

### Warning!

These names must match. If they don't, failure is guaranteed!

 

AS/400 System Name

Use the name, determined on page 4, found on the top right comer of the AS/400
Sign On screen. It is 8 characters long and usually begins with an “S.”

Logging Detail

The log file contains exactly what is displayed in the DIS Electronic Commerce
Client log window during transfers between the AS/400 and PC. One log file is
created for each day. If the download is ran more than once during the day, the

record of activity is added (appended) to the day’s log.

The level of detail may be brief, informational, or detailed (see page 11). The
amount of detail selection can be changed at any time. Log files can be viewed or
deleted by selecting File | Log File Management from the DIS ECC window.
When you select a log file to view, it is displayed in Notepad.

O Click on the Logging Detail down arrow to display the logging detail options.
O Click on the one you want. Detailed information is helpful if you're having
problems. For every day use, DIS recommends the Informational level.

Below are examples of each type as generated by the same stock order. DIS
recommends the Informational log because it furnishes enough information for
you to get a pretty good idea of what has happened. The brief log doesn’t even let
you know that the destination file was closed, which is how you know that data
was transferred successfully. The detailed log omits nothing and is usually more

STARTING COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS

AS/400 Program: Electronic Commerce Manager

O Normally, the DIS Electronic Commerce Manager (DISECM400) runs 24-
hours a day except when it is stopped by an IPL. It will be restarted after the
IPL. The jobs that use the Electronic Commerce Manager will start it if it is
not active: finalizing an order or return, or downloading a formatted financial
statement or parts locator file. You can verify that the job is running by typing
the following command at an AS/400 command line: WRKACTJOB [Enter].
Look for the job illustrated below:

 

Subsystem/Job User Type CPU % Function Status

DISECM400 Qsys SBS 0 DEQW
DISECM400 QPGMR BCH -0 PGM-MFG400ENGO DEQW

 

DIS Electronic Commerce Client (ECC)

The programs that process data on the PC are shut down whenever the PC is
rebooted or powered off; therefore, they must be restarted afterwards. Follow this
procedure every morning. Repeat it any time the PC is rebooted or Client Access
is restarted.

1, Start the PCs where the manufacturer’s communications software and ECC is
installed.

2. Start the DIS Business System on the PCs. This starts the Client Access
connection between the AS/400 and the PCs.

3. Start ECC. ECC starts the data queue on the AS/400 and the polling process.
It must be running for information to be transferred successfully to and from
the AS/400 and the PCs.

Windows 3.17

—- To start DIS ECC from Program Manager, double click on the DIS
Applications icon. Within the DIS Applications group, double click on the
DIS Electronic Commerce Client icon.

Windows 95

— To start DIS ECC, select Start | Programs | DIS Applications | DIS
Electronic Commerce Client.

### Troubleshooting

Verifying Transfers

To verify that a file has been successfully downloaded and is ready for
transmission to the manufacturer, look in the DIS Electronic Commerce Client
window on the PC where the log is displayed. Look for the line: “Destination file
closed,” which means the file has been transferred from the AS/400 to the PC in
the format requested by the manufacturer.

37 AM: Data received, lene
‘37 AM: Data received, ler
18:36 AM: Data received, ler

  
  

If you don’t see the line, you can wait for the next polling time—the DIS
Electronic Commerce Client polls the AS/400 every 10 minutes (or the number
you set in Configuration).


X6.15-1 « ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION RELEASE 2.3

 

Tf you are in a hurry, you can click on More Detail>> to expand the dialog box, C
then click on Check AS/400 Now! to poll the AS/400 immediately.

nding 23 by

 

Check AS/400 Now! Doesn’t Display Data

Tf you click on Check AS/400 Now! and don’t see any data, verify the Electronic
Commerce Configuration (X6.15-1) on the AS/400.

1. Verify the Parameters configuration and repeat for all manufacturers in all
divisions. Make sure the workstation name is the same as the AS/400
workstation name configured in ECC on the PC. Make sure the library name
is DISSYSOBJ. See page Error! Bookmark not defined..

2. Verify the Security configuration. See page 31.

Client Access Crashes During Print & Finalize

If Client Access crashes while you are printing and finalizing an order on the
Order Information screen, go back into the Print & Finalize screens.


SECURITY & CONFIGURATION X6.15-1 «e ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION 37

 

ECM has the same recovery feature currently in the DIS Business System
product. If the Print and Finalize process is interrupted, the next time the you
start that process you will return to the screen you were using.

Corporate Order Error Messages

When you are using Electronic Commerce and create a corporate order, the
system checks to see whether the sub-order vendors have been set up in Configure
Electronic Commerce.

If none of the vendors have been set up in Configure Electronic Commerce, the
order is finalized as usual.

if all of the vendors are set up in Configure Electronic Commerce for the same
communications package and they all pass security, the order is finalized and the
appropriate Order Information screen for Electronic Commerce is presented.

If one or more of the vendors are not set up in Configure Electronic Commerce,
the following error codes may be displayed:

ERR: Invalid sub-order found verify EC configuration.

This error code indicates that not all orders passed security, not all orders are of
the same communication package, or an order was encountered that was not
configured.

ERR: Invalid vendor verify EC configuration.
This error code indicates that the vendor code selected was not set up in the main
division’s EC 400 configuration.

The order is then submitted under the first vendor code encountered. For example,
if MAS, HES, and GLE orders have been combined into a corporate order, the
first vendor encountered, MAS, will be used.

 

Manufacturer’s Communications Software Problems

If you encounter problems while using the manufacturer’s software, such as
AGCO Solutions On-Line or Clarknet II, other than missing order files
(described below), please call the manufacturer. DIS cannot provide support for
these packages.


38 X6.15-1 « ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION RELEASE 2.3

Missing Order Files

When your manufacturer’s communications software, such as AGCO Solutions
On-Line or Clarknet Il, does not find the order files it was expecting, follow
these steps to find out what is wrong.

ECC was not running

Assuming that configuration has been done correctly (previous orders have been
transferred successfully), it is most likely that ECC was not running on the PC
when Print & Finalize was done on the AS/400. All order types will remain on the
WRKACTIOB screen until ECC is started and the transfer occurs. Check the
ECC log for the "Destination file closed” message. Follow these steps to resolve
the issue:

Stock Order. Select Print/Finalize Order (X341-3) again.

Priority Order. The AS/400 will think the priority order was closed and
transmitted just fine. Do not attempt to back it out of the DIS Business System,
which will only waste a lot of time and totally mess up your reservations. Instead,
use the printout and re-create the order manually in the manufacturer’s software.
Receive it in the usual way when it comes in.

Verify Electronic Commerce Configuration

If ECC was running when the order was finalized, verify Electronic Commerce
Configuration (X6.15-1) on the AS/400. See Parameters on page Error!
Bookmark not defined., Security on page 31. In particular, verify the AS/400
Workstation Name on the AS/400 and PC match exactly.

Check Configuration of PC directories

Verify that the manufacturer’s software and ECC on the PC are configured for the
same PC directory.

In the manufacturer’s software, check the configuration. This will be different for
each manufacturer. Please refer to the manufacturer’s documentation. Make sure
the drive/directory combination matches what is in ECC.

To check ECC configuration on the PC, follow these steps:

(1 Start ECC. See page 34.

(1) Select Edit | Configuration.

C) Click on the manufacturer’ s tab.

O Verify the drive/directory combination for each type of order.


SECURITY & CONFIGURATION X6.15-1 « ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION 39

Print & Finalize Fails to Display Order Information Screens

If you don’t get the new Order Information screens illustrated in this Guide, verify
the Electronic Commerce configuration on the AS/400.

Make sure the order was for one of the vendors configured in Electronic
Commerce Configuration (X6.15-1).

Make sure the Electronic Commerce Manager OPT switch is set.

If it is for a configured vendor, check the configuration carefully. Make sure the
Parameters and Security sections are configured correctly. See pages Error!
Bookmark not defined. and 31.

Ship To Address Information Missing

If the last part of your ship to address information was present on the AS/400 but
is missing when you open the order in the manufacturer’s communications
software, you probably used a tilde (~) somewhere on the Order Information
screen.

For the current order, simply add the information to the order in the
manufacturer’s software and process it as usual. To prevent this from happening
again on future orders, do not use a tilde (~) anywhere in the Order Information
screens. The tilde is used to indicate the end of the data in the data transfer
process.

Problems Caused by Multiple AS/400s

The problems described in this section are seldom encountered at a dealership.
They occur occasionally at DIS where there are multiple AS/400s.

AS/400 System Name Must Be Changed

If ECC is running when you decide to change the AS/400 System Name:

OQ Select File | Close Connection.

O Select Edit | Configuration.

(1 Change the AS/400 System Name. You must use all CAPS in this field.
OG Click on More Detail >>>.

1 Click on Check AS/400 Now! to connect to the new AS/400.

If ECC is not running when you decide to change the AS/400 System Name:
Method 1: Open ECC and follow the steps above.


40 X6.15-1 « ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION RELEASE 2.3

Method 2: This is the easiest if you are not configured at the Client Access
Workstation level for this AS/400. Verify ECC is closed and manually edit the
CAWINDOWSUIS.INI file. The cleanest way is to change the AS/400 System
Name to the install default value of $0000001, then start ECC. This will open the
dialog box with no further challenges. You may then modify the data in the field.

System Security Dialog Box

‘You may get a System Security dialog box, requesting a Userid and Password, as
illustrated below, when you start ECC or when there is no Client Access sessions
Or connections at the time ECC is started.

 

When ECC is configured for a specific AS/400, ECC automatically connects to

that AS/400 when it is started. If, for some reason, you have it configured for an {
AS/400 that you are not currently connected to, you will see a Client Access

System Security dialog box.

Example. My ECC is configured for $100008G as that is where I was last using
it. lam currently only logged onto $100276G. When I open ECC I will see a
Userid/Password dialog box with S100008G on the title bar.

The Bearing Interchange Menu, illustrated above, consists of 2 jobs.
Option 1 loads Bearing Interchange information onto the hard disk. It is
stored in Library QS36F in file BIX. In addition, the following alternate
index files are used: BIXLO, BIXL1, and BIXL2.

Option 2 is a table that cross-references manufacturers from the tape to
your 3-character DIS vendor codes. Up to 10 DIS vendor codes can be
assigned to a single manufacturer. The table must be completed before the
Bearing Interchange information will be available in programs that use the
parts search feature:

TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU

### Introduction

Point of Sale Table Maintenance Menu allows you to create the tables to
be used at Point of Sale. The tables must be set up before you can perform
Point of Sale Invoicing.

Think of Point of Sale as a game. Before you play any game, you need to
know the rules. For example in Monopoly the rules state that you go
clockwise around the board, collect 200.00 when you pass go. You get one
roll of the dice unless you roll doubles. Only the player landing on
property can purchase the property. The rules are two typed pages long.

Think of the Point of Sale tables as the rules of the game. Before you can
play the game, the rules must be established. The rules established here
govern accounting transactions.

We have enclosed some ideas for setting up the different tables. Each
dealership is unique. These codes provided are just suggestions. Use
whatever codes work best for your dealership.

### Overview

The Point of Sale Table Maintenance Menu contains the following jobs.
Certain tables are required before Point of Sale Invoicing can be run.
X52-1 Customer Index Setup (required):
Customer Index Setup adds customers set up in
Receivables Maintenance to the Customer Index that
displays for Point of Sale Invoicing.

X52-2 Document Classification Codes (required):
This job allows you to establish the types of documents that
will be used for Point of Sale Invoicing. You set up the
code for the document and the first number that will be


[| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU

XS2-3

X52-4

X52-5

X52-6

X52-7

used.

Sales Code Maintenance (required):

Sales Code Maintenance is used to set up the sales codes
for Point of Sale. Items are sold at Point of Sale using Sales
Codes. Each time a sales code is used, the people running
Point of Sale are generating accounting transactions for
posting by the accounting department.

Vendor/Class Table (optional):

Vendor/Class table is used when the parts sales are divided
by vendor in the Chart of Accounts. The Vendor/Class
Table affects all of the individual part sales accounts using
only one sales code.

Standard Line Maintenance (optional):

Standard Line Maintenance allows you to set up frequently
sold parts or services so when sold, they do not need to be
re-keyed in every time during invoicing. Only the standard
line code needs to be entered.

Discount Maintenance (required):

Discount codes allow subtraction of a percentage of the
sales price on a line-by-line basis at Point of Sale. The
discount code can also function as a surcharge. A
percentage of the sale can be added to the invoice on a
line-by-line basis.

Tax Configuration Maintenance: (required)

Tax Configuration Maintenance is used to set up tax codes
for use at Point of Sale. Up to four different tax rates such
as State, City, County and Township can be charged with
one tax code and stored in up to four different general
L.


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [2]

ledger accounts.

X52-8 Invoice Heading Maintenance: (optional)
Invoice Heading Maintenance allows you to print your
company heading at the top of the Point of Sale document.
it also allows you to print messages. This job is divisional.
If you have more than one division, each division must
have an invoice heading set up.

X52-9 Price Table Maintenance (optional):
The Price Table can be used for charging customers a rate
at Point of Sale that is different from what is charged to
most customers. For example, tie warranty vendors to
110% of cost.

If you have any questions on the concepts and theory of setting up the

tables, read the following sections carefully. If not proceed to the
referenced chapters and set up the tables.

### How Point Of Sale Tables Are Used

The Point of Sale Tables will be used to create accounting transactions.
Point of Sale allows a transaction to be generated for every type of sale
your dealership does. The Point of Sale codes work together to make these
transactions.

Certain tables are required to do Point of Sale invoicing. Other tables may
make life easier, but are not essential to work Point of Sale. Below are
explanations of the tables necessary to run Point of Sale.

Each of the tables must be set up for each division. There are some
exceptions, and they are listed in the chapters.

### Document Classification Codes

When creating a Point of Sale document, the first entry will be a document
type. You must decide what type of document you will open: counter
ticket, repair order, etc.

Document Classification codes define the documents to be used at Point of
Sale. Any number of document types can be chosen, but most dealerships
can operate with two, Counter Tickets and Repair Orders.

The more types chosen, the more complicated Point of Sale becomes. Set

up enough codes for your business to operate efficiently, but keep in mind
the larger the choice for the people operating Point of Sale, the greater the
chance of error.

RELEASE 2.2 c


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [=]

Document Classification codes are set up in Document Classification
Maintenance (X52-2). You will select the type of documents and choose
the first number for the first document opened of each type. After the first
document of each type is opened, the computer will issue documents in
numerical order. You will be able to trace a document number through the
system. It is a perfect audit trail.

### Sales Codes

Sales Codes are the heart and soul of Point of Sale Invoicing. A sales code
must be used to sell anything at Point of Sale. Each time a sales code is
used, the people at Point of Sale are generating accounting transactions for
posting by the accounting department. Sales codes direct debits and credits
to general ledger accounts depending on whether the document opened is a
counter ticket or a repair order.

A sales code is required for every type of sale that is to be made at Point of
Sale. When a sales code is used, it will debit one general ledger and credit
another general ledger account. Depending upon the document type, one
of three sets of general ledger accounts will be used per sales code.

When you set up sales codes, you may specify separate debit and credit
accounts for customer documents, internal documents, and warranty
documents.

Sales codes used in counter tickets will generate accounting transactions
for general ledger accounts defined for customer documents.

Sales codes used in repair orders can generate accounting transactions for

## X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU

 

general ledger accounts defined for customer, internal or warranty
documents.

A sales code will be necessary to credit each sale account on your chart of
accounts. Below is the sales account section on the chart of accounts for
ABC Company:

WHAT IS REQUIRED TO SET UP A SALES CODE

Select Codes in Sort Order

When a document is closed and a copy given to the customer, sales codes
will sort in alpha- numeric order. When setting up the sales codes, it is
important to set them up so that they will sort properly on the document.

Sales codes are two spaces long. Codes are selected to represent the type
of sales transaction that is being performed at Point of Sale.

Looking at the sample chart of accounts, you will see the sales accounts
Parts Counter, Internal, and Shop. You have available to you, two spaces
for the sales code. You might choose first character based on what is being
sold, parts.

For the first character of the sales code for parts use P.

The second character of the sales code could be based on department.
ABC Company is using Counter and Shop. For Counter, they select C; for
Shop, they select S. The sales codes selected so far are:

PC = Parts Counter

PS= Parts Shop

The PC sales code will only be used for customer sales made at the parts
counter. This code will only generate accounting entries for the customer
document set of general ledger accounts. The PS sales code will be may be
used for counter tickets or work orders. In work orders, this sales code will
allow you to generate accounting entries for either the customer document,
internal document, or warranty documents sets of general ledger accounts.


ABC Company prefers labor to sort below part sales. Looking at ABC's
Chart of Accounts, they have two labor sale accounts, Labor Customer and
Labor Internal. Since labor is only used in work orders, only one sales
code is needed. This sales code will have general ledger accounts specified
for customer documents, internal documents, and warranty documents.
The customer document set of general ledger accounts will include a credit
to CUSTOMER LABOR, account D3370. The internal document set of
general ledger accounts will include a credit to INTERNAL LABOR,
account D3380. To make labor sort below part sales on the document, they
select T as the first character of the labor sales codes.

TL = Labor
** is a special character sales used at ABC Company. It will sort before
the alpha character sales codes discussed above. The sales code chart so
far looks like this:

ae

PC = Parts Counter
PS = Parts Shop
TL = Labor

Select codes according to where you want them to sort on the document.

QL


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [2]

Description

A field is provided when setting up a sales code called Description. The
Description entered in this field will display when the document is printed
and closed. ABC Company uses the following descriptions for their parts
sales codes:

PC = Parts Counter
PS = Parts Shop

When the Point of Sale documents are printed, the descriptions Parts
counter and Parts Shop will display on the document as information for
whoever receives the document.

There is one exception. If a sales code will be used to send a message at
Point of Sale, there should be no description used in the Description field.
For example ABC Company uses ** to send messages to the shop. The **
sorts to the top of the document. They can write the labor necessary on the
document. It appears at the top of the document.

If a description of Message had been used in the Description field at Point
of Sale, the description would look like this on the document:
MESSAGE
FIX CLUTCH.
Without the word "MESSAGE", ABC COMPANY will see:
FIX CLUTCH.
Think about what you want to print on the document when choosing your

descriptions. If you want to write messages using particular sales codes,
leave the description field blank.


[| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU co

Formats

There are several formats that can be used when setting up sales codes.
The different formats require or allow different information to be supplied
when using the sales code on a Point of Sale document.

There are 10 different formats to choose from. They are:

M= Misc. Description P= Parts

N = Notes U = Miscellaneous Unit
W = Wholegoods (Units) D = Description
L=Labor A = Received on Account
C= Cash Prepayment S = Miscellaneous Cost

T = Miscellaneous Cost Quantity

Below are examples of lines as they appear at Point of Sale. If a document
type is defined as a W (Work Order or Repair Order), an extra field
(Internal/Warranty) is displayed on the line for the following formats:

M = Misc Description P = Parts
D= Description L=Labor
S = Misc Cost

In the examples that follow, the "I/W" field is shown as it would appear on
a repair order.

M = Miscellaneous quantity:

This format is used when selling parts that are not in inventory. It can
be used to sell any item that is sold requiring the quantity of the item to
be multiplied by the price. All that is required when using a
miscellaneous format is a quantity and unit price. A field is present for
a description.

RELEASE 2.2 Lo ‘

### X5-2 Table Maintenance Menu ["]

Not all parts you sell have a part number in your inventory. You may
sell nuts and bolts that have part numbers and appear on the parts pad
but you may also sell other nuts and bolts that do not have part
numbers. The miscellaneous quantity format is especially helpful for
rentals, and "D" lines are eligible for periodic billing (they are copied to
the clone document).

You would need two sales codes to cover this situation, one with a
miscellaneous format. Miscellaneous format does not require a valid
part number. Below is an example of a Miscellaneous Quantity format
that has been used to sell a 3/4" bolt.

If the document chosen is a Repair Order, you will see:

N = Notes

Used to make notes not related to any general ledger accounts. This
format is recommended although the miscellaneous description can
also be used for notes. There is less chance for error with the note
format since there is no way to enter an amount. When a sales code has
an N format, the line looks like this at Point of Sale:

P = Parts (
Used to sell parts in inventory. This format requires a vendor code,

quantity to be sold and valid part number. When a sales code has a P

format, the line looks like this at Point of Sale. Below is an example of

a line selling a filter.

W = Units (Wholegoods)

This format is used to sell units or wholegoods. The format requires a
valid stock number set up in (X2- 1), warranty code, and warranty
expiration date. The code for the Units (Wholegoods) format is W. If a
unit is sold or returned with a "W" format, the system checks the sales
code. If it finds *SALE or an actual general ledger account number in
the customer credit account field, it checks the amount field. If the
amount is positive (the unit is being sold), the unit must not have been
sold previously. If the amount is negative (the unit is being returned),
the unit must have been sold earlier. When a sales code uses a.W
format, the line displays like this at Point of Sale invoicing. Below is a
sample of a unit (wholegood) being sold:

D = Miscellaneous Description

The "D" format can be used to sell anything where the quantity is not
relevant, such as freight. It is especially helpful for rentals, and "D"
lines are eligible for periodic billing (they are copied to the clone
document). See also, line type "S" (below).

This format can be used to place messages to your customers on
documents. You can write messages to the customer explaining rental
terms, labor charges, freight charges, or sales information. You can
write messages to your shop regarding the labor to be done for a


[| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU ae

customer or internally. There are no required fields when miscellaneous
description format is used on a sales code. When selling freight, or
postage, you would want to fill in the description and price. If writing
messages, do not fill in the amount, or better yet, choose the "Note"
format.

When a D is used as the format of a sales code, the line displays like
this at Point of Sale Invoicing. Below is an example of freight being
sold at Point of Sale.

The new Miscelianeous Unit sales code prints as 5 lines on invoice.
“Date in" and "Date out" are added to the printed invoice. Fields for
date (out/in) and meter reading (out/in) are also available.

The sales code format “U" (Miscellaneous Unit) accommodates a rental
sales flag (RSF), which is the connection from the rental invoice to the
rental status code. The rental sales flag (RSF) may be one of the

following:

Flag
R=Rented

U=Undo

B=Bypass

Result

Rental status is changed from AV=Available
to RE=Rented.

If the unit is already rented, an error
message lets you know what document
number the unit was rented on.

Only units rented with periodic invoicing are
eligible for the "Undo" feature. Also, the
original rental document must be posted.
The unit is removed from periodic billing
and its rental status is changed from
RE=Rented to AV=Available.

Rental status is not changed.

{| Do not use rental sales flags of "U" and "R" for the same unit on the
same document.

Accounting Information

When a sales code is set up, you pick a general ledger account that will be
debited and one that will be credited for that code. When the code is used
at Point of Sale, the correct accounting is entered as if you were entering
debits and credits to sales journals on your old system.

RELEASE 2.2 tO


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [=]

There are three types or groups of charges: Customer, Internal and
Warranty charges. The accounting may be different on these types of
charges, but the accounting can usually be covered with one sales code.

When you charge to a customer, you debit an accounts receivable account
and credit a particular sales account.

Warranty charges are usually to a Warranty Customer that may be charged
to the same general ledger account as customer receivables or may have a
different general ledger number. When warranty work is done, the debit is
toa Warranty Receivable or expense and the credit is toa particular sales
account.

Tf work is done on an internal unit, it raises the cost of that unit. When a
document is open to a unit, you would debit inventory (to raise the cost of
the unit) and credit a particular sales account.

In Receivables Maintenance (X11-2), you assign an address number to a
customer and tie that address number to a receivable general ledger
account number.

In Receivables Maintenance, you assign an address number to a warranty
customer and tie that address number to a warranty receivable general
ledger account number or to an expense account. The field labeled
“Int/Warr” accepts an "I" or "W" to identify the address as Internal or
Warranty for Point of Sale Reports, such as Salesperson and Labor
Analysis Reports (X56-3 & 4).

There are other types of internal charges other than to inventory.
Sometimes you want to charge a particular expense account while
crediting a sale account. Another type of internal charge would be paid
outs, money paid out at the parts counter for various expenses. The


[| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU .

accounting is a credit to cash and debit to the expense account. For
example, set up the pop machine with an address number of COKE in
Receivables Maintenance (X11-2). Tie the address number to the expense
account you use to pay for pop.

When setting up sales codes, the document types you would be concemed
with would be customer and intemal. Your expense accounts are set up as
customers. When a document is opened to the pop man at Point of Sale,
use the Paid Out sales code. The expense account is debited and the cash
account is credited.

In Inquire/Update Units (X2-1), you assign a unit or stock number to a
unit and tie it to an inventory general ledger account number.

When a document is opened at Point of Sale Invoicing (X5-1), it is opened (
as either a counter ticket to a customer or as a repair order. Sales codes

used on a counter ticket will debit and credit the customer document set of
general ledger accounts. Sales codes used on a repair

order can debit and credit accounts specified for customer documents,
internal documents, or warranty documents.

COUNTER TICKETS - Document type 'S' (sales order)
Customer Documents
Each sales code has a customer document section. You must assign a
debit general ledger account and a credit general ledger account.

Examine your Chart of Accounts. Decide which sales accounts are

used for customers. A credit will be made to a sales account and the
debit will be made to the receivables account.

RELEASE 2.2 CL


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [=]

A debit and credit account has to be added on each sales code, but
there are some "wild cards" that can be substituted for general ledger
account numbers. This allows you to use one sales code for special
types of Point of Sale transactions.

You could have several types of receivable customers tied to several
receivable general ledger accounts, parts receivables customers,
expense accounts receivables, and equipment purchasing receivables.

There is a “wild card" that can be used for the debit general ledger
account, *AUTO. When *AUTO is used as the debit account, the
computer will look at the customer address number being used at Point
of Sale Invoicing and find the general ledger account associated with
that customer address number.

When setting up unit inventory general ledger numbers in general
ledger Account Maintenance {X%14-2), a W edit code is used. A W edit
code requires that a inventory sale account (account 1) and inventory
cost of sale (account 2) be entered. Inventory can be traced through the
system by the unit number assigned to the unit. Only one sales code is
necessary to post sales to any unit inventory sale account. There is a
“wild card" provided.

The "wild card", *SALE, would be entered as the credit on the sales
code set up for unit sales. Using *SALE will cause the computer to
examine the unit number being sold to the customer. Depending on the
unit number sold, the computer will find the unit inventory sale
account to be credited.

A sales code used for selling a unit would use the “wild card" *AUTO
as the debit and *SALE as the credit.


[=| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU

If you have set up your parts sales accounts by vendor, there is a “wild
card" that can be set up on the credit side of the customer document.
For example if you sell parts Massey, Case, Honda, Cummins, Detroit
Diesel, and have sales account general ledger numbers that are different
for each vendor, set up a Vendor/Class Table (X53-4) before setting up
your sales codes.

In Vendor/Class Maintenance, you tie a vendor code to a sale general
ledger number. You may break it down further than that. Each Class of
parts per vendor can be tied to a separate general ledger account
number. Then you may use *SALE on part format sales codes. What
this wild card does is to search on the vendor placed on the invoice line
and credit the part sales account. The sales code would use *AUTO for
the debit and *SALE as the credit.

REPAIR ORDERS - Document type ‘R' (repair order)

Repair orders are used to charge parts and labor to customers, internal
units, internal address numbers, and warrantors. One work order may
create transactions to all three of these entities (customer, internal, and
warranty).

When opening a work order, you start by opening the document to either a
customer, internal number, or warrantor. If you open the repair order to a
customer, the sales codes will then use the general ledger accounts that
were specified for customer documents. You can, however, charge
individual line items to a internal address number or warrantor through the
use of the I/W option on the entry line.

By marking the /W option field, the accounting transactions for the sales
code will use either the internal or warranty document set of general ledger
accounts rather than the customer document set of accounts. It is through
this option that you can generate three sets of transactions from one sales


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [=]

code. Remember, this flexibility is only available on repair order
documents.

Customer Documents: Sales made to customers on a repair order work
in the same manner as the description provided in the section on
Counter Tickets. The sales codes that you use for repair orders may be
different from those used for counter sales.

In our example, we set up two sales codes for parts sales. One sales
code, PC, credits the general ledger account for sales made at the parts
counter. The other sales code, PS, credits the general ledger account for
shop parts sales. If you only had one general ledger account for parts
‘sales, you would not have to make this distinction.

Internal Documents: These documents are used for charging costs

for items such as parts, oil changes, prep for sale, and other charges to
pieces of equipment or units. This type of document will debit your
inventory and credit the sales account. For each sales code you must
assign a debit general ledger account and a credit general ledger
account.

Examine your Chart of Accounts. Decide which sales accounts are to
be used for internal charges. The sales accounts will be the credit entry
and the inventory account will be the debit.

Because you could have several inventory accounts, Case inventory,
Honda Inventory, Cummins Inventory, there is a “wild card" that can
be used for the debit general ledger account, *AUTO.

When *AUTO is used as the debit account, the computer will look at

the unit number on the document at Point of Sale invoicing and find
the general ledger account associated with the unit number. You are


 

working with any number of sales account. The sales code would have
a debit of “AUTO and a credit to any sale account. You will

probably need several sales codes using *AUTO as the debit and a
sale account as the credit.

If you set up your parts sales accounts by vendor, there is a "wild
card" that can be set up on the credit side of the internal document.

For example if you sell parts Massey, Case, Honda, Cummins, Detroit
Diesel, and have sales account general ledger numbers that are different
for each vendor, set up a Vendor/Class (X53-4) before setting up your
sales codes. In Vendor/Class Maintenance, you tie a vendor code to a
sale general ledger number. Then you may use *SALE, instead of a
general ledger sale account number on part format sales codes.

This “wild card" causes the computer to search on the vendor and the
class of the part being sold and credit the proper part sales account. The
sales code will use *AUTO as the debit to inventory and *SALE as the
credit.

When setting up your sales codes, the code wiil contain two sides. On
one side will be the customer document and on the other will be the
internal. You must enter a debit and credit account for each side of the
sales code even if the sales code does not apply to one side or the other.
See the Error Catching Accounts section for details.

Warranty Documents: Each sales code has a customer document
section. Whether or not the Warranty Documents section is valid
depends on the sales code format chosen.

If you choose one of the following formats, you must complete the
Warranty Documents section of the sales code:

RELEASE 2.2 CU .


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [=]

M = Misc. Description P= Parts S = Misc. Cost
D = Description L= Labor

If you choose one of the following formats, you cannot enter any
accounting information in the Warranty Documents section of the sales
code:

W = Wholegoods A= Received on Account
C = Cash Prepayment

The same rules apply for the Warranty Document section as for the
Customer section. In may cases the accounting will be exactly the
same. You must supply a debit and credit account. For more
information, see WARRANTY & INTERNAL CHARGES in

Examine your Chart of Accounts. Decide which sales accounts are
used for Warranty. A credit will be made to a sales account and the
debit will be made to the warranty receivable or expense account.

A debit and credit account has to be added on each sales code, but
there are some "wild cards" that can be substituted for general ledger
account numbers. This allows you to use one sales code for special
types of Point of Sale transactions.

You could have several types of receivable customers tied to several
receivable general ledger accounts, parts receivables customers,
expense accounts receivables, and equipment purchasing receivables.

There is a "wild card" that can be used for the debit general ledger

account, *AUTO. When *AUTO is used as the debit account, the
computer will look at the warranty address number being used at Point


 

of Sale Invoicing and find the general ledger account associated with
that customer address number.

When setting up unit inventory general ledger numbers in general
jiedger Account Maintenance (X14-2), a W edit code is used. A W edit
code requires that a inventory sale account (account 1) and inventory
cost of sale (account 2) be entered. Inventory can be traced through the
system by the unit number assigned to the unit. Only one sales code is
necessary to post sales to any unit inventory sale account. There is a
“wild card" provided.

The “wild card", *SALE, would be entered as the credit on the sales
code set up for unit sales. Using *SALE will cause the computer to
examine the unit number being sold to the customer. Depending on the
unit number sold, the computer will find the unit inventory sale
account to be credited.

A sales code used for selling a unit would use the "wild card" *AUTO
as the debit and *SALE as the credit.

Tf you have set up your parts sales accounts by vendor, there is a “wild
card" that can be set up on the credit side of the customer document.
For example if you sell parts Massey, Case, Honda, Cummins, Detroit
Diesel, and have sales account general ledger numbers that are different
for each vendor, set up a Vendor/Class Table (X53-4) before setting up
your sales codes.

In Vendor/Class Maintenance, you tie a vendor code to a sale general
ledger number. You may break it down further than that. Bach Class of
parts per vendor can be tied to a separate general ledger account
number. Then you may use *SALE on part format sales codes. What
this wild card does is to search on the vendor placed on the invoice line


and credit the part sales account. The sales code would use *AUTO for
the debit and *SALE as the credit.

Discount on Sales Account

You will supply a discount on sales general ledger number for each sales
code. If you do not offer sales discounts or do not keep track of sales
discounts in a separate general ledger, you can put in the sales account
general ledger number. This will debit any discounts on a Point of Sale
document back to the sales account, reducing the profit on the sale.

Default Vendor for Parts Format

This option is only valid when a parts format is chosen for a sales code.
You may use the vendor code for your major line. When the sales code is
chosen at Point of Sale, the vendor code field will already display your
major vendor. It will only have to be entered when selling parts for another
vendor. This means less typing strokes for the person creating the
document at Point of Sale.

If you change vendors often, you may want to leave this field blank.

Error Catching Wildcard - *ERROR

Not all sales codes will be valid for customer, warranty and internal
documents. For example, you will sell units to customers, but you don't
usually sell a unit to another unit. If a person is doing invoicing and enters
the wrong sales code, you want a way to catch the error and correct it
before you post to the general ledger.

Use the *ERROR wildcard instead of account numbers when setting up


 

sales codes. If you are setting up a sales code for internal use only, type
*ERROR in place of account numbers in the customer account fields.

When you create a Point of Sale posting batch, the documents closed at
Point of Sale invoicing, will be included in the batch. When the batch is
created, the screens displayed for your review will be identical to the
screens in Create Source Documents (X1-7). Therefore, if you use a
*ERROR wildcard as the credit or debit general ledger account number for
the sales codes that have invalid internal or customer sides of the
document, error messages will display:

DIS-1161 General Ledger account number does not exist.
DIS-1500 Sales Code was used improperly in Point of Sale.

Since all errors must be fixed before you can post a batch, you will not (
post to the wrong general ledger account.

Look at the following example of a Point of Sale posting batch. At Point
of Sale, sales code ** was used to add a comment to a document opened to
a customer. By mistake, someone entered a dollar amount on the comment
line. If you entered ERROR wildcards on the customer document side of
the sales code, you would see the following:

ABC COMPANY POST SOURCE DOCUMENTS 6/24/96 1710-501

RELEASE 2.2 LO


On the debit line (line #10), there is a customer's address number in the
Addr # field. This means that the document was open to a customer. On
the credit line (line #20), the sales code used displays in the first two
positions of the Description field. ** is the comment sales code and should
not be used with a dollar amount. Because you entered a *ERROR
wildcard as the debit and credit on the ** sales code, the errors can be
caught before posting.

The document number is also visible. You can pull the paper copy of the
document to trace the error. Viewing the document should help you decide
what accounts should really be debited and credited. The errors can be
corrected before they are posted to the general ledger.

### Create Your Sales Code Table

With your Chart of Accounts in hand, make yourself a table like the one
listed below. Fill in the information using your general ledger account
numbers. These are suggested sales codes. Every dealership will be
different. This is just to give you some ideas.

Take note of the accounting involved on sales code EU, unit trade in. You
may be thinking that the inventory account should be debited and the
account receivable account credited. When the line is entered on the
invoice, you want the total to be subtracted from what the customer owes
on the new unit he is purchasing.

When the Trade-In is added on the document, press the field minus key to
make the dollar amount show as a minus from the purchase of the new
unit. When the Field Minus key is pressed, it also flips the accounting
around, allowing the inventory account to be debited and the receivable
account to be credited.

When the document is printed, the total of the document will reflect the
trade-in as a negative number and when the batch is created, the

accounting will be correct.

When the batch is created, an error will print below the Unit Trade line:
Stock number must be entered.


[=| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU

You must set up the stock (unit) number in Inquire/Update Units (X2-1)
and enter the stock (unit) number in the batch to post the batch. The D
format does not request a stock number be entered until you are ready to
post the batch. If you used a W format, which requires a stock number, the
number would have to be set up before the invoice could be created. Also,
you would have to enter a warranty code and warranty expiration code.

When you have completed your table, you are ready to set up your sales
codes.

### Discounts At Point Of Sale

Discount codes must be set up before Point of Sale Invoicing can be
performed.

Discounts are added to a document on a line- by-line basis. Every line
added to a document must include a discount code.

Set up a Blank Discount Code

Even if discounts are not offered at your dealership, you must set up a
discount to operate Point of Sale. A blank code is a valid discount code.
When the line displays at Point of Sale, the discount field is left blank. A
discount code has been added to the line, blank is a valid discount code.

We recommend that the blank discount code be set up to reflect the

discount offered most often by the dealership. If you do not offer
discounts, use the blank discount code to mean no discount. If you offer

RELEASE 2.2 Lo


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [=]

three percent discount on cash, and most customers pay cash, set up the
blank discount code to give three percent discount.

Discounts are set up in Discount Maintenance (X32-6). See the chapter for
details on how to run the job.

Tie Discounts to Customers

Discount codes can be tied to individual customers in Receivables
Maintenance (X11-2). Place the discount code in the Discount code field
under Point of Sale Information on the Receivables Maintenance screen.
A blank discount code is valid. If no discount code is tied to the customer,
the discount rate associated with the blank code is the default for the
customer on a Point of Sale document.

Discounts are given on a line-by-line basis. The code can be changed by
changing what displays in the discount field on the Point of Sale line.

How Discounts Work at Point of Sale

Below is an example of an open document from Point of Sale:

### Abc Company Sales Order X5100-106

Notice two part numbers have already been added to the document. At the
top of the document three fields are listed, TDP. The T stands for tax code,
the D indicates the discount and P indicates the priority order code.

The discount is a line by line code. You can give a discount on one part
and not give a discount on another part. In the example, the document
already contains two parts. Another part is being added to the invoice. At
the bottom of the document, a quantity, vendor, and part number have
been added to the line. Under the Discount field, a 1 has been typed.

After passing the security gate at Discount Maintenance, the following
screen will display:

Two DISCOUNT CONFIGURATION tables are available.
1. Division D
2. Company

Point of Sale checks the Divisional table first.

(mdi-Cancel job

If you have only one division, no decision is necessary. Entering either a D
for divisional or C for company wide table will have the same result. If
you have more than one division, you must decide which table to use.

The computer will search for a divisional table first. If one is not found, a
company table will be searched.


 

If you have the same discount rates for all divisions, choose a company
table. You will only have to set up the discount codes in one division.
Enter C to maintain a company wide table.

If you have one or more divisions with different discount rates offered,
select D to maintain a divisional table. Set up the discount codes in each
separate division.

One more example, if you have six divisions, five of which have the same
discount rates, do the following:

O Open the discount codes in one of the five divisions that have the
same discount rates. On the Discount Maintenance screen, choose C to
maintain a company wide table.

O Open the discount codes in the sixth division, the one that has (
different discount rates. Choose D for divisional table in the sixth
division.

‘When documents are opened in the five divisions that have the same
discount codes, the computer will search for a divisional table. It will
not find one. It will go to the company table for the proper
information.

When a document is open in the sixth division, the computer will

search for discount information in the divisional table and find it there.
It will not go to the company table.

### The Theory Of Tax Codes At Point Of Sale

Tax codes, another table that is required at Point of Sale, are set up in Tax
Configuration Maintenance (X52-7).

Tax codes are entered on a line-by-line basis. Every line at Point of Sale
must use a tax code. The tax codes must be set up in Tax Configuration
Maintenance to be valid.

Tax codes can be tied to the customer at Receivables Maintenance
(X11-2). Place the tax code in the Tax code field under Point of Sale
Information on the Receivables Maintenance screen. When a document is
opened to the customer, the tax code entered will display on the Point of
Sale Line.

Tax is charged on a line-by-line basis, The code can be changed by typing
over the code displayed. A different tax rate can be charged on each line.

If your dealership is located in a state that requires a breakdown of sales
exempt information on a form, tax exempt information can be broken
down and obtained by the use of tax codes.

Set up a different tax code for each reason that you do not charge tax.
G = Government

R = Resale
N =No tax (for any exception to the rules)
L =Labor

A = Agriculture exemption
O = Out of State customer


[=| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU .

A report can be obtained by running Transaction Report Writer (X1-6).
The report will provide the separation necessary to fill out the tax forms
required by the state. See Transaction Report Writer (X1-6) and (X16-2)
for a sample reports.

Charge Different Rates Using the Same Code

When setting up tax codes, you will have the opportunity to set up
different rates for each tax code. You can set up four different sales tax
rates for each tax code.

For example, say the state charges 5.2% tax. The county has an additional

1.5% sales tax. The township charges an additional .5% sales. The total

tax is 7.2%. If you have three tax liability accounts, you can divide the
percentages up to credit the three liability accounts. The customer will see (
only the total tax and not the general ledger breakdown.

How Tax Codes Work at Point of Sale

Point of Sale Invoicing uses tax codes in the following order:
1) Standard Line

2) Sales Code

3) Customer

Subsequent lines use the tax code established by the standard line or sales
code. Using a new standard line or sales code that carries a non-blank tax

code resets the default; however, you'll need to [Field Exit] through the
default if you want to return to the customer's tax code.

Tax codes are entered on a line-by-line basis at Point of Sale Invoicing.

This way you can tax parts sales but not tax labor sales. Look at the
example of a Point of Sale document below:

When the tax code L is entered onto the document, no tax is charged on

the line containing the L tax code. Labor is tax exempt in the state where
ABC Company is located.

At the top of the Sales Order screen, you will see three fields displayed,
TDP. T = tax code, D = discount code, P = priority order code for parts.


[| X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU

In the example above, the parts entered on the document will be taxed, but
the labor, once the line is entered, will not be taxed.

Tax Codes for Different Divisions

### X5-2 Table Maintenance Menu [«]

If you have more than one division, you must decide which table to use.

The computer will search for a divisional table first. If one is not found, a
company table will be searched.

If you have the same tax rates for all divisions, and keep the tax dollars
collected in one general ledger account, choose a company table. You will
only have to set up the tax codes in one division. Enter C to maintain a
company wide table.

If you have one or more divisions that differ in tax rates charged or each
division has its own sales tax liability general ledger account, select D to
maintain a divisional table. Set up the tax codes in each separate division.

### Theory Of Standard Lines

Standard Lines are not required; however, they will make life easier.
Standard Lines are used to sell frequently sold parts and services. When a
Standard line is set up, the name of the standard line is used to replace
some of the typing strokes that would take place. The concept of Standard
Lines can be made easier if we follow an example through. You can then
apply the concept to other items sold at Point of Sale.

Standard Lines are especially helpful for rental units. If you have an
extensive fleet, a standard line can include the standard rate for a unit.


“~,

 

Example of Standard Line

Labor is a commonly sold item at ABC Company. First let's define the
labor.

The ABC Company has employed Stanley as their star mechanic for years.
Stanley is very good and people bring their equipment from miles around
just to have Stanley place his golden hands on it. You can well imagine
that the ABC Company can not afford to tie up Stanley with internal
matters such as fixing the fleet vehicles.

Stanley only works for customers and ABC charges a rate of $42.00 an
hour. Stanley's initials are set up as his Employee number in the Employee

For each customer that ABC Company sells labor to, they must enter the
same information for each document:

LABOR Job Date of Hours
TDIW Line SC Employee Code Work Report Billed

N 0010 TC SR 010 © 120696 400 350
Standard line code

 

They enter the same sales code, the same employee name, the same labor
rate per hour. Labor is not taxed or discounted, so the same tax code and
discount code must be entered each time. The only information that varies
is the job code, hours reported, the hours billed and the date of Stanley's
work. By setting up LABOR as a Standard Line Code, the standard line
can be entered in the "Standard line code" field and some of the typing
eliminated.

RELEASE 2.2 Ney


 

Charlie, the Accountant, is always upset with Reed, the partsman, because
Reed forgets to add the discount and tax code. Charlie always has to fix
the Point of Sale batch because tax is being charged and discounts given to
the customers.

We can help Reed out by eliminating some of his typing and help Charlie
by eliminating the chance of Reed making the mistakes Charlie has to fix.

How is this done? Set LABOR up as a Standard line.

Type the name of the Standard Line to be set up, LABOR. Press Enter.
The following screen will display:

When the Labor Sales Code was created in Sales Code Maintenance
(X52-3), a format was chosen for the sales code. If you have questions
regarding the sales codes and their formats, the Theory of Sales Codes in

Different information is required on different lines at Point of Sale. The
fields on the Standard Line Maintenance screen will be different
depending on the format of the sales code.

Labor (L) format requires, who did the work (Employee #), date of the
work, report hours (actual hours worked on the project), bill hours
(number of hours to be billed to the customer), rate per hour (amount
charged per hour of work).

### The Theory Of Price Table Maintenance

The Price Table can be used for charging customers a rate at Point of Sale
that is different from what is charged to most customers when selling
parts.

Customers do not need to be tied to the Price Table to operate Point of
Sale.

As an example, warranty vendors may be charged 10% above the cost of
parts for warranty work your shop performs. You can tie warranty address
numbers set up in Receivables Maintenance (X11-2) to be charged 110%
of cost at Point of Sale.

The benefit to people operating Point of Sale is that they do not need to
know what pricing the customer receives, The price will be charged
automatically.

Price Table Maintenance will only effect pricing on Point of Sale lines that
have a P (Parts) format.

Stock (unit) numbers can be tied to the table. Most dealerships charge cost
only on parts placed on internal units. When a document is opened to an
internal, cost of the parts will be charged to the internal.

On the Price Table Maintenance screen, the address # of the customer or
the Stock # of the unit is entered. Some customers or internals may be
charged a different price on parts from one vendor that another vendor.

You have the option to select the vendor code and class code of parts for
pricing to the customer or intemal. Some customers receive a special price


[=] X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU

on all vendors and classes of parts purchased. To offer a special price on
all vendors and classes of parts, leave the fields blank.

After choosing the vendors and classes of parts, the pricing code is
selected. There are four Price codes for parts. At Point of Sale, the pricing
code will display in the Base field on the Sales/W' ork order screen.

Dealer List =4
Suggested List =3
Internal =2
Dealer Net =1

Dealer list, price column 4, is the price most commonly charged to

customers. After selecting the Vendor Code and Class codes for the parts,

select the pricing column to be charged. If tying a unit to dealer net, the (
price column selected would be 1. If tying warranty receivable customers

to dealer net, the price column would be 1. If a customer is charged 90%

of dealer list, the price code would be 4.

Pricing for the customer or internal will be determined by the table. If a

price is entered in the Price field at Point of Sale, the price will override
the Price Table. See Price Table Maintenance X52-9.

RELEASE 2.2 Lu


X5-2 TABLE MAINTENANCE MENU [=]

### What Happens Next

The next step is to tape copies of all the tables to the terminals that will be
used to run Point of Sale Invoicing.

To run Point of Sale, you will need copies of the:

Document Classification Table (52-2)
Sales Code Table (52-3)
Discount Code Table (X53-6)
Tax Configuration Table (X52-7)
Vendor/Class Table (optional) (X52-4)
Standard Line Table (optional) (X52-5)

There are two ways to get copies of the tables.

O Go into the job. When you get to the screen asking for the code,
press Cmd1. A picture of the table will print. Repeat to get additional
copies of the tables.

O Stop the printer. Go into the job. When you come to the screen where
the code is entered, press Cmd1. Repeat for all chapters containing the
necessary tables.

STARTING COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS

AS/400 Program: Electronic Commerce Manager

O Normally, the DIS Electronic Commerce Manager (DISECM400) nuns 24-
hours a day except when it is stopped by an IPL. It will be restarted after the
IPL. The jobs that use the Electronic Commerce Manager will start it if it is
not active: finalizing an order or return, or downloading a formatted financial
statement or parts locator file. You can verify that the job is running by typing
the following command at an AS/400 command line: WRKACTJOB [Enter].
Look for the job illustrated below:

 

Subsystem/Job User Type CPU % Function Status
DISECM400 ess SBS +0 DEQW
DISECN400 QPGMR BCH -0 PGM-MFGSOCENGG © DEQW

 

DIS Electronic Commerce Client (ECC)

The programs that process data on the PC are shut down whenever the PC is
rebooted or powered off; therefore, they must be restarted afterwards. Follow this
procedure every morning. Repeat it any time the PC is rebooted or Client Access
is restarted.

1. Start the PCs where the manufacturer’s communications software and ECC is
installed.

2. Start the DIS Business System on the PCs. This starts the Client Access
connection between the AS/400 and the PCs.

3. Start ECC. ECC starts the data queue on the AS/400 and the polling process.
It must be running for information to be transferred successfully to and from
the AS/400 and the PCs.

Windows 3.11

— Tostart DIS ECC from Program Manager, double click on the DIS
Applications icon. Within the DIS Applications group, double click on the
DIS Electronic Commerce Client icon.

Windows 95

— Tostart DIS ECC, select Start | Programs | DIS Applications | DIS
Electronic Commerce Client.


SECURITY & CONFIGURATION X6.15-1 « ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONFIGURATION 29

 

### Troubleshooting

To verify that an itern (order, parts locator file, return, etc.) has been successfully
downloaded and is ready for transmission to the manufacturer, look in the DIS
Electronic Commerce Client window on the PC where the log is displayed. Look
for the line: “Destination file closed,” which means the order has been transferred
from the AS/400 to the PC in the format requested by the manufacturer.

If you don’t see the line, you can wait for the next polling time—the DIS
Electronic Commerce Client polls the AS/400 every 10 minutes (or the number
you set in Configuration).

Tf you are in a hurry, you can click on More Detail>> to expand the dialog box,
then click on Check AS/400 Now! to poll the AS/400 immediately.

BACKUP ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
CONFIGURATION FILES

### Introduction

Use this option to back up your Electronic Commerce configuration files. DIS
Electronic Commerce Manager 400 runs in Library DISFILES, so it doesn’t
interfere with DIS Backup. Since the configuration is not included in DIS Backup,
this option is used for backing the configuration up to tape, use option 3 to restore
it in case of emergency.

Before you start, please make sure that you are using TAPO] and that you have

removed your DIS backup tape.

PART SALES HISTORY

### Introduction

### Warning

Tracking this information takes a lot of disk space. To track 150

invoices a day, each with an average of 4 part lines, requires 7.2-8.5
MB per month on an AS/400 or 2800-3300 blocks per month on a

| S/36.

L__—

 

Use Part Sales History to review sales and returns by any combination of
the following items:

= Customer or Unit Number

= Vendor or Vendor and Part Number
= Date range

= Document number

Quick codes may, also, be used to access part information. Results are
always displayed on screen first, and you can Tequest printouts, if desired.

Part Sales History is installed from the OPTDIS Library (X636-9), The
default is not installed. The detail displayed by this job is usually removed
from the system by the End of Month Procedure (X5-4). After the Part
Sales History OPT has been installed, go to Security Maintenance (X6-6).
Look for the field labeled "Part Hist Mos" and enter the number of months
you want to keep (up to 999). The system begins tracking part sales
history the next time a Point of Sale Posting Batch (X55-1) is created.

Although detail is retained only as long as specified in Security
Maintenance, the history summary is maintained as long as the customer
or unit number remains in the system. If customers are deleted, their part
sales history is deleted the next time Parts End of Month Procedures (X3-
9) are run, regardless of whether their history falls within the specified
number of months.


[2] X5-7 PART SALES HISTORY c

Since this job deals with history files, it is possible that one or more items
may have been deleted since the document was created, such as the
division, customer, unit number, vendor, or part number. Even so, it is
possible to look up the history.

END OF MONTH PROCEDURE

### Introduction

Point of Sale End of Month Procedure is a job that should be run at least
once a month. It can be run more than once a month to improve
performance at Point of Sale.

This procedure takes care of necessary file maintenance and file
reorganization for Point of Sale Invoicing. It cleans up the main Point of
Sale file, u.SAM (u = your user ID). All documents that were closed and
posted before the cutoff date you designate are removed from the
document index.

Why is this helpful to you? Since all documents are listed in a customer's
document index, it can become a chore to find the one you want. The list
can be very long and the process time-consuming. Running End of Month
Procedures decreases the size of each customer's document index by
removing closed, posted documents.

Before document detail is removed, run the Salesperson and Labor
Analysis Reports (X56-3 and X56-4).


[2] X5-4 END OF MONTH PROCEDURE

### Preparation

Before running Point of Sale End of Month:

O Run Priority Orders (X5-3) to process any dropship parts.

O Run the Salesperson and Labor Analysis Reports (X56-3 and X56-4).

PRIORITY ORDERS

### Introduction

Use this option to:

= make changes to any part placed on priority order
= add parts to the priority order

= add parts to the order that are not in inventory

In Point of Sale Invoicing (X5-1), parts with no available quantity are
frequently encountered. These parts can be handled in different ways:
1) deleted from the document

2) recorded as lost sales

3) placed on priority order

4) placed on a stock order

5) robbed and not reordered (provided there is some on hand quantity)
6) robbed and reordered

Drop ship parts and actions 2-6 are aiso covered. See also Recovering a
Priority Order, which is at the end of this chapter.

The system will pick up and order parts, including, drop ship parts from
both open and closed documents. You can go back later and add freight
before you close the ticket.

An OPT X636E-3,4 allows you to decide whether you want to drop ship
parts from both open and closed documents to be included in the priority
order queue (default) or whether you prefer to have only those from closed
documents in the queue.

A separate priority order is created at Point of Sale Invoicing for each
vendor. The order is then accepted or finalized. A copy of the order prints
for submission to the manufacturer. This job allows you to process priority
orders from multiple vendors at the same time and will remember the
special instructions entered for each one.


[2] X5-3 PRIORITY ORDERS 0 .

### Overview

At Point of Sale, if a customer wants to purchase a part that is not in stock
or inventory, the part can be priority ordered. The part number entered is
checked for quantity available for sale. This does not mean the quantity on
hand. There may be 3 parts on hand, but if other documents at Point of
Sale have created reservations for two of the parts, only one is available
for sale. If an attempt is made to sell two of the parts at Point of Sale, 1
will be placed on the Priority Order Queue.

When a part number is added to a document a "P" is displayed in the Pty

field on the line. The “P" is a Priority order code. It means, order the part.

There are three reasons that a part is placed on the Priority Order Queue:

= The part is reserved on another Point of Sale document. (
= The part is not in stock and must be ordered.

= The inventory count is off.

The part is not placed on the Priority Order Queue until the document is
either closed or placed on hold.

When a part is priority ordered, the job of finalizing the priority orders is
done in this job, Priority Orders (X5-3). All parts that are priority order
queued by Point of Sale documents will display. They will remain on
priority order until the order is accepted.

For more details on priority orders, see Priority Orders in the Reference
Section of Chapter X5-1 Point of Sale Invoicing.

RELEASE 2.2 Ne


X5-3 PRIORITY ORDERS [=]

Definitions of Priority Order Codes

When the part is available, the priority code is blank. The "P" means
Priority Order the part. Parts with a priority code of "P" are counted as
"Filled after ordering" on the Parts Management Report. In addition to the
"P" action code, "1," "2," "3," and "4" may also be used for priority orders.
All of these order codes are treated by the computer in the same way; the
advantage of having multiple priority order codes is that you can organize
your priority orders in five separate categories. Once a part that has a
priority code is ordered, it will have an "a" code regardless of its original
priority code.

There are other Priority codes that can be used in place of the large "P" on
a Point of Sale document.

R =Rob the reservation and do not order.
Q =Rob the reservation and order the part.
S = Place the part on a stock order.

L =Lost sale.

D = Dropship.

Uses of the code are explained below:

R= __ Rob the reservation and do not order
When you change the "P" to "R", you are robbing a reservation
created by another document at Point of Sale. The computer has
determined that there is not enough inventory available to fill the
reservation created by the document. Using "R" will allow the part
to be sold; however, no Priority order will be created for the part
and it will be counted filled "First Time" on the Parts Management
Report.

### [+] X5-3 Priority Orders

There are two reasons you might rob the reservation:

1. The inventory count is off. There are really 3 parts in the part
bin. The computer shows 2 parts in the bin. Selling 3 parts creates
a-] available. Back the cursor to the Pty field. Change the "P" to
“R" to rob the reservation. When the customer leaves, go to Parts
Posting and Maintenance (X3-2) and correct the quantity. Plus (P)
in one of the parts. Make sure you correct your inventory. Control
becomes a large problem if inventory is not corrected.

2. The part is really reserved for an internal work order. You would
rather sel] the part at a profit to a customer than place it on a piece
of your equipment. It may be cheaper to order the part on a regular
stock order than on priority order. Change the "P" in the Pty field
to "R". After the customer leaves, recall the internal document.
Remove the part from the document. Do not skip this step. It
corrects the inventory.

Rob the reservation and order the part

This would be used to sell a part reserved on a ticket to someone
else. For example a part was ordered for a customer (Mr. Smith). It
arrives and he will not be using it right away. Another customer
(Mr. Jones) needs the part now. When the part is typed onto the
document opened to Mr. Jones, a "P" appears indicating that the
part is not available for sale.

In reviewing the Reservations Report, you see a reservation for Mr.
Smith. Mr. Smith does not need the part now. On the document for
Mr. Jones, change the "P" to a "Q". You can then sell the part to
Mr. Jones and another part will be ordered for Mr. Smith. The
reservation is retained for Mr. Smith. His name will show on the
Reservations Report. The part is counted as filled "First Time" on
or,


X5-3 PRIORITY ORDERS [=]

the Parts Management Report.

When the part is received in Receive Order (X342-2,) no name or
customer address number will be displayed for the part on the
Receipt to Reservations Report. Run a Reservations by Part
Number Report. Determine who should receive the part and
process that customer's document.

S= Place the part on a stock order
Freight and UPS charges are usually higher on a Priority order than
on a regular stock order. If a customer is in no hurry to receive a
part, the part can be placed on a stock order to be ordered with the
regular stock order.

Change the "P" that appears on the part line to a "S". The part will
display on the Priority Order Queue in this job. Parts sold with
priority codes of "S" are counted as filled "After Ordering" on the
Parts Management Report when the "S" changes to "a" to signify
that they have been received.

When the order is accepted, a stock order is created, which is
named MMDDHHnd, where:

MM=Current month

DD=Current day

HH=Current hour in military time (4 P.M. is 16)

n=0-9 (orders for the same MMDDHH are numbered sequentially
from zero to 9)

d=division code

The parts are placed on MMDDHHnd. When you create a regular

stock order (X341-1 or X341-2), the parts can be moved from
order MMDDHHnd to the regular stock order with Move Order


(«| X5-3 PRIORITY ORDERS

Lines (X34-6).

Lost sale

When a part needs to be ordered, there is always a chance that the
customer will not want to wait until the part is received. The
customer may be able to go somewhere else to purchase the part.
Lost sales mean lost revenue. If there are not enough parts to meet
customer needs, something may be wrong with the dealership's
stocking levels.

When [Enter] is pressed on a part line, change the "P" to "L" to

indicate Lost Sale. The "L" increases the demand history for the

part. The demand history is used in the calculation formula for

Creating a Suggested Stock Order (X341-1). Parts with priority

codes of "L" are counted as Lost Sales on the Parts Management (
Report.

Dropship

Dropship means that the part ordered will be shipped directly to the
customer. The dealership will not receive the part. If this is the
case, change the "P" to "D". The Priority Order is processed as
usual. Parts sold with priority codes of "D" are counted as filled
"First Time" on the Parts Management Report. Processing the
order is explained in the section How to Run, later in this chapter.
Once the order is processed, there is no more tracking of the part
by the system.

An OPT (X636-14) allows you to decide whether you want
dropship parts from open and closed documents to be inciuded in
the priority order queue (default) o r whether you prefer to have
only those from closed documents in the queue. If a document is
opened to a dropship customer, place the Ship To address in the

{
RELEASE 2.2 \

## X5-3 PRIORITY ORDERS

Ship to field on the Point of Sale Sold to Screen. The document
must be closed to bill the customer.

Processing a Priority Code Document

When [Enter] is pressed on a part sale line, if the part is not available for
sale, a large "P” displays in the Pty field on the line. At that point, the
decision must be made as to which priority code is to be used.

Once the code is entered, the part is added to the document by pressing
[Enter] again. There are three fields at the top of the document. TDP.
T =tax code used, D = discount code used and P = priority code used.

The P field at the top of the document will display the priority order code.
For example, say the "P" remains as a Large "P". "P" means order the part.
The part is sent to the Priority Order queue to be ordered only when the
document is closed or placed on hold.

Only documents containing the priority order codes listed below will be
visible in the Priority Orders job (X5-3).

P = Priority order (1,2,3, or 4 will also work)

Q = Rob the reservation and order the part

D = Drop ship

S = Place the part on a stock order

You can see a field called Typ when reviewing a priority order. This field
holds the Priority Order code used at Point of Sale. P, D and S$ will be
visible as typed. If a Q was used, it will display as a P.

The codes L = Lost Sale and R = Rob the reservation and do not order,
will not display on the priority order.


X5-3 PRIORITY ORDERS oe

When the Priority order is accepted, (X5-3), the large "P" (or the 1,2,3, or
4) on the document in the P field at the top of the document becomes a
small "p". The small "p" indicates that the part has been ordered. If you are
reviewing the document, and the "P" is still large, the Priority Orders
(X5-3) job has not been run and the parts have not been ordered.

‘When the part has been received in (X34-2), the small "p" will change to a
small "a". The small "a" indicates the document can be closed and the
customer billed. The small "a" means available for sale. Parts sold with
priority codes of “a” are counted as filled "After Ordering" on the Parts
Management Report.

If the priority order code was changed to an S = place on stock order, an
"S" will display until the priority order is accepted in this job. When the
order is accepted, a stock order is created, which is named MMDDHHnd, (
where:
MMs=Current month
DD=Current day
HH=Current hour in military time (4 P.M. is 16)
n=0-9 (orders for the same MMDDHH are numbered sequentially from
zero to 9)
d=division code

The parts are placed on MMDDHHnd. When you create a regular stock
order (X341-1 or X341-2), the parts can be moved from order
MMDDHHnd to the regular stock order with Move Order Lines (X34-6).

Accepting the order changes the large "S" to a small "s" on the Point of
Sale document. When the order is received (X342-2), the smal] "s"

becomes small “a". The document can be closed and the customer billed.

OTHER FACTS ABOUT PRIORITY ORDERS

Codes that display at Priority Order

Only Parts with priority codes listed below will display on the priority
order queue until the order is accepted.

P = Priority order (or 1,2,3, or 4)

Q = Rob the reservation and order the part
D = Dropship

S = Place the part on a stock order

Parts sold with priority codes of "Q," and "R" are counted as filled "First
Time" on the Parts Management Report.

Changing Priority Orders

In this job, you will have the opportunity to make changes to parts already
on the priority order. You will also be able to add parts to the order or add
parts to inventory and the order.

Parts are placed on Priority Order Queue by selling parts not available at
Point of Sale. When you enter the Priority Orders job, the computer
checks Point of Sale documents for priority order codes.

Any changes made to the priority order are not tied back to documents at
Point of Sale. Changes or additions to the order will not register until the
Priority Order is accepted or finalized. Do not go into the job to make
changes or add parts until you are ready to accept (finalize) the order.


If you leave the priority order without accepting the order, the program
assumes that any changes made were not valid. When you go back into the
priority order the second time, it will look like it did the first time you
reviewed it. The changes will have to be made again.

Receiving Priority Orders

When the parts are received, the order must processed in Receive
Order(X342-2). For information on this job, See Chapter X34-2, Receive
Order Menu.

If you have questions on how to sell partially received priority orders,see
Sell a Partially Received Priority Order in the Reference Section of Point
of Sale Invoicing (X5-1).

Accepting Priority Orders

On the screen above, there is an N (No) displayed under the Accept?
column. The order should not be accepted before it is reviewed. You may
want to make changes or additions to the order. Leave the N for No. This
will give you the opportunity to review the order before accepting it.

Accepting the order has the same result on priority orders as Print Final
Order (X341-3) has on stock orders. The result is that the order is finalized
and the order is printed.

When a part order is received at the dealership, you update computer
inventory by receiving the order in Receive Order (X342-2). An order
cannot be received in Receive Order (X342-2) until it has been finalized.
Once the order is accepted, the word Final will display in the Status field
in Order Inquiry (X34-4). Only when the word Final is displayed can the
order be received.

There is ne requirement as to the order in which you review Priority

orders. To review an order, type the Vendor Code for the priority order in
the Update Priority order for vendor: field. Press [Enter].

The Accept? (Y/N) field will display a N (No) just as the previous screen
did. You will change the N (No) to Y (Yes) when the order has been
reviewed and you are ready to accept or finalize the order.

The screen displays all the detail of the orders. The fields are described
below. Each part on the priority order takes up two lines on the screen:

### Fields & Descriptions

The fields on the first line are:
Typ This field will hold the Priority Code chosen
during Point of Sale Invoicing.

P will display if either a P = Priority Order
or a Q= Rob and place on priority order was
used at Point of Sale Invoicing.

D = Dropship will display if a D was used.
Tracking of parts with a D code stops with
the acceptance of the Priority Order. After
the order is accepted, it is up to the
manufacturer to ship the parts. The customer
was billed for the parts when the document
was closed.

S = Place on stock order. When the order is
accepted, all parts displaying S in the field
will be placed on a system-created stock
order, MMDDHHnd, where:

MM=Current month

DD=Current day


D/B

HH=Current hour in military time (4 P.M. is
16)

n=0-9 (orders for the same MMDDHH are
numbered sequentially from zero to 9)
d=division code

When you create a regular stock order
(341-1 or X341-2), the parts can be moved
from order MMDDHHnd to the regular
stock order with Move Order Lines (X34-6).

For more information on these codes, see the
Overview section of this chapter or Priority
Orders in the Reference section of X5-1
Point of Sale Invoicing.

When changing the Typ code, only S =
Place on stock order and P = Priority order
can be used. You may not change a code to
or from D = Dropship.

Delete or Bypass.

Type a D to delete a part from the priority
order. When the priority order is accepted,
the document will display a small "p" as if
the part has been ordered. The "p" indicates
the order has been accepted. Deleting the
part off the priority order does not eliminate
the reservation created by the Point of Sale
document.

Tf enough of the part is received on a
suggested stock order, the reservation is


X5-3 PRIORITY ORDERS [7]

filled. The small "p" becomes a small "a" at
Point of Sale. You can fill the order, close
the document and bill the customer. If the
reservation is filled, the customer will be
listed on the Receipt to

Reservations Report that is printed with
Receive Order (X32-2).

If you deleted the part because the customer
does not want the part, you must go to Point
of Sale and delete the part from the
document. The reservation will remain until
the part is deleted off the document or the
part is received on a stock order and the
document is closed.

Type B to bypass the part on the order. The
part will not be placed on this priority order.
The part will remain on the Priority Order

### Recovering Priority Orders

The command key recovery [Cmd24], which was used in previous releases
(prior to Release 2.1), has been eliminated and replaced by a more reliable
method. The rules for working with priority orders are the same:

= Only one workstation in each division can be using a priority order
option.

= Until the first workstation has completed its priority order option
successfully, no other workstation can use any of the priority order
options.

It wasn't always possible to know for sure which workstation had been (
using which priority order job; therefore, a screen has been added to

clarify what needs to be done to recover successfully. If any other

workstation in Division A selects any one of the four priority order options
before the first workstation has ended the job normally, the following

message, which is explained on the next page, is displayed:

f
RELEASE 2.2 We


‘Nit EQUIPMENT SALES Priority Orders X5300-B01,
Division: A

Only one workstation per division may process priority orders at the
same time.

Workstation AF is either currently running this job from Menu X53 or
was interrupted before the job covld complete.

If workstation AF is not currently running this job from Menu x53,
xestart this job from Menu X53 at workstation AF to either cancel or
finish the priority orders.

Press Enter to return to the menu.

 

For example, if workstation AF enters Priority Orders from the Point of
Sale Menu in Division A, no other workstation in Division A can start any
of the other priority order jobs (Case, Viscom, or Navistar) until
workstation AF has ended its job normally. If workstation AF is still using
Priority Orders, it must complete the job normally. If workstation AF was
interrupted while it was processing priority orders, it must re-enter the
same menu option, which will resume at the point of interruption, and
complete it normally.

Note

  

Changes to priority orders are not linked to a document at Point of Sale. They will
not be retained unless you accept and finalize the order. If you leave the priority
order without accepting the order, the program assumes that the changes are not
valid. When you go back into the priority order the second time, it will look like it
did the first time you reviewed it. The changes must be made again.

POINT OF SALE X5-3 ¢ PRIORITY ORDERS 3

### Overview

In Point of Sale Invoicing (X5-1), parts with no available quantity are frequently
encountered. These parts can be handled in different ways:

deleted from the document

recorded as lost sales

placed on priority order

placed on a stock order

tobbed and not reordered (provided there is some on hand quantity)

robbed and reordered

### Amwpyd

In this chapter, drop ship parts and actions 2-6 are also covered. See also
Recovering a Priority Order, which is at the end of this chapter.

The system will pick up and order parts, including drop ship parts from both open
and closed documents. You can go back later and add freight before you close the
ticket.

  

An OPT allows you to decide whether you want to drop ship parts from both open
and closed documents to be included in the priority order queue (default) or
whether you prefer to have only those from closed documents in the queue. See
Chapter X63-6 Point of Sale OPTs.

 
   
     

At Point of Sale, if a customer wants to purchase a part that is not in stock or
inventory, the part can be priority ordered. The part number entered is checked for
quantity available for sale. This does not mean the quantity on hand. There may
be 3 parts on hand, but if other documents at Point of Sale have created
reservations for two of the parts, only one is available for sale. If an attempt is
made to sell two of the parts at Point of Sale, 1 will be placed on the Priority
Order Queue.

When a part number is added to a document a "P" is displayed in the Pty field on
the line. The "P" is a Priority order code. It means, order the part. There are 3
reasons a part may be placed on the Priority Order Queue:

1. The part is reserved on another Point of Sale document.
2. The part is not in stock and must be ordered.
3. The inventory count is off.


X5-3 ¢ PRIORITY ORDERS RELEASE 2.3

 


Parts are displayed on separate priority orders, which are created for each vendor
and accepted (finalized) in Priority Orders. Hard copies, which can be submitted
to the manufacturers, are printed; however, most manufacturers now
accommodate electronic ordering.

For more details on priority orders, see Priority Orders in the Reference Section of
Chapter X5-1 Point of Sale Invoicing.

Definitions of Priority Order Codes

‘When the part is available, the priority code is blank. The "P” means Priority
Order the part. Parts with a priority code of "P" are counted as "Filled after
ordering” on the Parts Management Report. In addition to the "P" action code,
"1," "2," "3," and "4" may also be used for priority orders. All of these order
codes are treated by the computer in the same way; the advantage of having
multiple priority order codes is that you can organize your priority orders in five
separate categories. Once a part that has a priority code is ordered, it will have an

a" code regardless of its original priority code.

There are other Priority codes that can be used in place of the large "P" on a Point {
of Sale document.

R =Rob the reservation and do not order.
Q =Rob the reservation and order the part.
S = Place the part on a stock order.

L = Lost sale.

D = Drop ship.

Uses of the code are explained below:

R=Rob, do not order

AnR priority code means rob the reservation and do not order.

When you change the "P" to "R," you are robbing a reservation created by another
document at Point of Sale. The computer has determined that there is not enough
inventory available to fill the reservation created by the document. Using "R" will
allow the part to be sold; however, no Priority order will be created for the part
and it will be counted filled “First Time" on the Parts Management Report.

There are 2 reasons you might rob the reservation:
1. The inventory count is off. There are really 3 parts in the part bin. The

computer shows 2 parts in the bin. Selling 3 parts creates a -1 available. Back -
the cursor to the Pty field. Change the "P" to "R" to rob the reservation. When .


POINT OF SALE X5-3 ¢ PRIORITY ORDERS 5

the customer leaves, go to Parts Posting and Maintenance (X3-2) and correct
the quantity. Plus (P) in one of the parts. Make sure you correct your
inventory. Control becomes a large problem if inventory is not corrected.

2. The part is really reserved for an internal work order. You would rather sell
the part at a profit to a customer than place it on a piece of your equipment. It
may be cheaper to order the part on a regular stock order than on priority
order. Change the "P” in the Pty field to "R". After the customer leaves, recall
the internal document. Remove the part from the document. Do not skip this
step. It corrects the inventory.

Q=Rob and reorder

A “Q” priority code is used to sell a part that is reserved on a ticket for someone
else. For example a part was ordered for a customer (Mr. Smith). It arrives and he
will not be using it right away. Another customer (Mr. Jones) needs the part now.
When the part is typed onto the document opened to Mr. Jones, a "P" appears
indicating that the part is not available for sale.

In reviewing the Reservations Report, you see a reservation for Mr. Smith. Mr.
Smith does not need the part now. On the document for Mr. Jones, change the "P"
to a"Q". You can then sell the part to Mr. Jones and another part will be ordered
for Mr. Smith. The reservation is retained for Mr. Smith. His name will show on
the Reservations Report. The part is counted as filled "First Time" on the Parts
Management Report.

When the part is received in Receive Order (X342-2,) no name or customer
address number will be displayed for the part on the Receipt to Reservations
Report. Run a Reservations by Part Number Report. Determine who should
receive the part and process that customer's document.

=Place the part on a stock order

Freight and UPS charges are usually higher on a Priority order than on a regular
stock order. If a customer is in no hurry to receive a part, the part can be ordered
with the regular stock order.

Change the “P" that appears on the part line to aS." The part will be displayed
on the Priority Order Queue in this job. Parts sold with priority codes of "S" are
counted as filled "After Ordering" on the Parts Management Report when the "S"
changes to "a" to signify that they have been received.
When the order is accepted, stock order, MMDDHHnd, is created.

MM=Current month

DD=Current day

HH=Current hour in military time (4 P.M. is 16)


X5-3 e PRIORITY ORDERS RELEASE 2.3


n=0-9 (orders for the same MMDDHH are numbered sequentially from
zero to 9)
d=division code

The parts are placed on MMDDHHnd. When you create a regular stock order
(X341-1 or X341-2), the parts can be moved from order MMDDHHnd to the
regular stock order with Move Order Lines (X34-6).

L=Lost sale

‘When a part needs to be ordered, there is always a chance that the customer will
not want to wait until the part is received. The customer may be able to go
somewhere else to purchase the part. Lost sales mean lost revenue. If there are not
enough parts to meet customer needs, something may be wrong with the
dealership's stocking levels.

Change the "P" to "L" to indicate Lost Sale. The "L" increases the demand history
for the part. The demand history is used in the calculation formula for Creating a
Suggested Stock Order (X341-1). Parts with priority codes of "L" are counted as
Lost Sales on the Parts Management Report.

D=Drop ship {
“Drop ship” means that the part ordered will be shipped directly to the customer.

The dealership will not receive the part. If this is the case, change the "P" to "D".

The Priority Order is processed as usual. Parts sold with priority codes of "D" are
counted as filled "First Time" on the Parts Management Report. Processing the

order is explained in the section How to Run, later in this chapter. Once the order

is processed, there is no more tracking of the part by the system.

An OPT allows you to decide whether you want drop ship parts from open and
closed documents to be included in the priority order queue (default) or whether
you prefer to have only those from closed documents in the queue. See Chapter
X63-6 Point of Sale OPTs. If a document is opened to a drop ship customer, place
the Ship To address in the Ship to field on the Point of Sale Sold to Screen. The
document must be closed to bill the customer.


POINT OF SALE X5-3 e PRIORITY ORDERS 7

 

Processing a Priority Code Document

When a part is not available for sale, the line is not placed on the ticket when you
press [Enter]; instead, a large "P" is displayed in the “Pty” field on the line. At
that point, the decision must be made as to which priority code is to be used.

Example:

Spec order parts -00 Avail total : ~00
CUSTOMER PARTS

TD Pty sc Ven Qty Part number Price Base

Ez PB 0010 PC CAS 2 a10059 1263 4

Standard line code No demand

Available C/T Res. R/O Res. On Order Super. Bin Dir. List
7- 7 0 7 N 12.63

   
   
  

TDP column

Once the code is entered, the part is added to the document by pressing [Enter]
again. At the top of the document, TDP represents the Tax, Discount, and Priority
order codes that apply to each line.

Example:

 
    
 

CREDIT INVOICE # cr09849 For s0154M CHARGE OPEN 3/24/99
sony ine # Qty vad Part Number Description Bin Ext Price
EP 0010 PC 2 CaS a10059 ELEMENT 4 25.26

 

The P field at the top of the document will display the priority order code. For
example, say the "P" remains as a Large "P." "P" means order the part. The part is
sent to the Priority Order queue to be ordered when the document is closed or
placed on hold.

Only documents containing the priority order codes listed below will be visible in
the Priority Orders job (X5-3).

P = Priority order (1,2,3, or 4 will also work)

Q = Rob the reservation and order the part

D = Drop ship

S = Place the part on a stock order

When you are reviewing a priority order, the “Typ” field holds the Priority Order
code used at Point of Sale. P, D and S will be visible as typed. If a Q was used, it
will be displayed as a P. Parts sold with priority codes of "Q," and "R" are
counted as filled "First Time" on the Parts Management Report. The codes L =


X5-3 « PRIORITY ORDERS RELEASE 2.3 CC

Lost Sale and R = Rob the reservation and do not order, will not be displayed on
the priority order.

P (or 1, 2,3, 4)~->p->a

When the Priority order is accepted, (X5-3), the large "P" (or the 1,2,3, or 4) on
the document in the P field at the top of the document becomes a smail "p." The
small "p" indicates that the part has been ordered. If you are reviewing the
document, and the "P" is still large, the Priority Orders (X5-3) job has not been

mun and the parts have not been ordered.

When the part has been received in (X34-2), the small “p" will change to a small
"a." The small "a" indicates the document can be closed and the customer billed.
The small "a" means available for sale. Parts sold with priority codes of "a" are
counted as filled "After Ordering” on the Parts Management Report.

S$ ->s-—>a

If the priority order code was changed to an S = place on stock order, an "S" will
display until the priority order is accepted in this job. When the order is accepted,
a stock order is created, which is named MMDDHHnd, where: (
MM=Current month
DD=Current day
HH=Current hour in military time (4 P.M. is 16)
n=0-9 (orders for the same MMDDHH are numbered sequentially from zero
to 9)
d=division code

The parts are placed on MMDDHHnd. When you create a regular stock order
(X341-1 or X341-2), the parts can be moved from order MMDDHHnd to the
regular stock order with Move Order Lines (X34-6).

Accepting the order changes the large "S" to a small "s" on the Point of Sale
document. When the order is received (X342-2), the small "s"

becomes small "a." The document can be closed and the customer billed.

Receiving Priority Orders

When the parts are received, the order must processed in Receive Order (X342-2)
or, for Case orders, in Automatic Order Receive (X723-1).

If you have questions on how to sell partially received priority orders, see Sell a
Partially Received Priority Order in the Reference Section of Point of Sale ‘o >

orders are on the Priority Order Queue, the Priority Orders Order Header screen
will be the first screen displayed.

Below is an example of the Priority Orders Order Header screen:

LRB SALES & SERVICE Priority Orders 5300-502
Stere: T Order Header

Vendor Code CAS Order Date 3/23/99

Order Number 0323150T Dealer Number 0022385800

cmdi-cancel

 

 

The Vendor code and Order date will be displayed. An order number, which may
be changed, is assigned: mmddyynd (mmddyy= current system date, n=sequence
nurnber, d=division code) The Dealer number will contain what is typed in the
Dealer number field at Configure Vendor/Class (X38-1). If one is not displayed,
or the one displayed is not correct, you may correct the field.

You may enter any information you want in the Special instructions field. The
field should refer to special shipping instructions for the manufacturer.

When the screen is complete, press [Enter]. The order is finalized and a copy of
the order will be printed. See next page if it is a Case order.

### Recovering Priority Orders

The command key recovery [Cmd24], which was used in previous releases (prior
to Release 2.1), has been eliminated and replaced by a more reliable method. The
rules for working with priority orders are the same:

1. Only one workstation in each division can be using a priority order option.

2. Until the first workstation has completed its priority order option successfully,
no other workstation can use any of the priority order options.

It wasn't always possible to know for sure which workstation had been using
which priority order job; therefore, a screen has been added to clarify what needs
to be done to recover successfully. If any other workstation in Division A selects
any one of the four priority order options before the first workstation has ended
the job normally, the following message, which is explained on the next page, is
displayed:

LRB SALES & SERVICE Priority Orders %5300-B01
Division: A

Only one workstation per division may process priority orders at the
same time.

Workstation AF is either currently running this job from Menu X53 or
was interrupted before the job could complete.

Tf workstation AF is not currently running this job from Menu X53,
restart this job from Menu X53 at workstation AF to either cancel or
finish the priority orders.

Press Enter to return to the menu.

For example, if workstation AF enters Priority Orders from the Point of Sale
Menu in Division A, no other workstation in Division A can start any of the other
priority order jobs (Case, Viscom, or Navistar) until workstation AF has ended its
job normally. If workstation AF is still using Priority Orders, it must complete the
Job normally. If workstation AF was interrupted while it was processing priority
orders, it must re-enter the same menu option, which will resume at the point of
interruption, and complete it normally.
