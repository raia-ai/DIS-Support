long_description: "This technical document serves as a comprehensive user manual for the Sales 360 module, a feature within the DIS (Dealer Information Systems) Quantum platform. The guide is designed for dealership administrators and sales representatives. It begins by outlining the administrative steps required to grant sales representatives access to Sales 360 through the Security Maintenance settings. It then provides a detailed walkthrough of the Sales 360 dashboard, focusing on key features. A major section is dedicated to the Quantum Calendar, explaining how to enable it by linking a Google Account, schedule events, and edit existing entries. The document also covers the creation and management of department-wide messages that appear on the dashboard. A significant portion is dedicated to sales activities, including how to create and track sales calls, with a graphical breakdown of performance metrics. The quoting functionality is extensively covered, detailing the process of creating a standard quote, a quote for a future (non-inventoried) unit, and adding trade-in information. It also explains how to customize quote templates, generate PDFs, and convert quotes to Point of Sale (P.O.S.) invoices. Finally, the guide explains how to manage contacts, add photos and signatures for sales reps, and use the integrated search functions."
