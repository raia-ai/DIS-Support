short_description: "A technical guide for the DIS Quantum software, detailing the process for cleaning up and merging incorrect or duplicate unit Make and Model table entries to ensure data accuracy."
long_description: "This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for users of the DIS Quantum software on how to perform routine maintenance of Make and Model table entries. Incorrectly entered unit Makes and Models can lead to overlooked inventory or customer units, complicating management and reporting. This guide outlines the best practices for identifying and correcting these errors. It is divided into two main procedures: merging unit Makes and merging unit Models. The 'Merge Unit Makes' section explains how to select a standard Make and merge all its variations (e.g., misspellings) into the correct entry. The 'Merge Unit Models' section details how to delete an incorrect model and reassign any units associated with it to the correct Make and Model combination. By following these procedures, users can maintain a clean and accurate database, improving the efficiency of searching for and working with units."
