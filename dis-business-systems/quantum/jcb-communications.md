## Introduction
JCB Communications allows you to maintain a consistent inventory level for JCB parts through part file transfers between your dealership's system and JCB. You can specify the vendor/code combinations to consider when generating the inventory files, submit files to generate suggested orders immediately or with backup, resend files that failed during submission, and specify customer sales transactions to remove from consideration when generating suggested stock orders.

## Configure JCB Communications
In order for your system to communicate with JCB and transfer the files necessary to maintain desired part inventory, configuration will need to be completed. Setup will be completed with DIS assistance.

1.  Select **Electronic Commerce Configuration** (`Security | Electronic Commerce | Electronic Commerce Communication`). The Electronic Commerce Communication screen opens.
2.  Click the **Add** button. The Add Vendor/Comm Package screen opens.
3.  Provide information in the available fields and click **OK**. The JCB Communications – Configure screen opens.

short_description: "A technical guide for dealership staff on using the Kubota Interface within the DIS Quantum system for Canadian operations. This document outlines procedures for checking part availability, locating parts at other dealerships, and placing and tracking orders."
long_description: "This document provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions for using the Kubota Interface (Canada) module in the DIS Quantum software. It is designed for dealership personnel responsible for parts management. The guide is divided into three main sections: Kubota Part Availability, Kubota Parts Locator, and Kubota Part Orders. The 'Part Availability' section details two methods for viewing part information, including quantity, price, and location within Kubota warehouses. The 'Parts Locator' section explains how to find parts at other dealerships and how to submit a dealership's own inventory to the Kubota network. The 'Part Orders' section provides a detailed walkthrough of the entire ordering process, from viewing pre-edit options and making shipping decisions to finalizing, validating, modifying (changing quantities or shipping methods), and transmitting the order to Kubota. It also covers how to check the status and track the delivery of an order once it has been placed. The document includes numerous screenshots of the DIS Quantum interface to visually guide users through each step."
