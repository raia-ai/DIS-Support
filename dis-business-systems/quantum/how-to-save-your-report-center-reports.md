## Introduction

To save paper, many dealerships setup their reports to go to the Quantum Report Center. However, spooled files (those stored in the Report Center) are not backed up. If a system failure occurs or if you upgrade to a new server, the reports stored in Report Center will be permanently deleted. This document provides instruction on how to save the reports from the Report Center to a folder on your desktop. Instructions are provided for Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.

## Save Reports to Folder

1.  Right-click your mouse anywhere on your blank desktop (blank computer screen) and select the Folder option (New | Folder).
    > **Note:** If you prefer, you can create and save the folder elsewhere on your computer.

short_description: "A technical guide on how to use an Excel spreadsheet to add new or update existing unit information in the Quantum system. It details the required CSV file format, column specifications, and the step-by-step import process."
long_description: "This document provides comprehensive instructions for importing unit information into the Quantum system using an Excel spreadsheet. This feature streamlines the process of adding or updating multiple units at once, eliminating the need for manual entry on multiple screens. The guide outlines key system behaviors, such as the automatic creation of new make/model entries if they don't exist and the generation of a 'Units Not Imported' report after each attempt. It specifies the required spreadsheet structure, including a detailed table of column headers, maximum character lengths, data types, and which fields are updatable. The document walks the user through creating the Excel file, saving it in the correct CSV format to a specific IFS path (/Keystone/Import/ImportUnits.csv), and finally, initiating the import process from the Quantum main menu. It also includes warnings about character limits and notes on where to find confirmation of a successful import."
