short_description: "A concise guide on how to add new makes and models to the DIS Quantum system directly from the Inquire/Update Units screen, a feature introduced in Release 21v1."
long_description: "This document provides a step-by-step tutorial for users of the DIS Quantum software, specifically for Release 21v1 and later. It details the process of adding new equipment Makes (up to 10 characters) and Models (up to 16 characters) into the system's Make/Model Table while in the process of entering new unit information. The instructions guide the user through the Inquire/Update Units workflow, from initiating the 'Add Unit' function, handling system validation messages for non-existent makes or models, to using the 'Add Make' and 'Add Model' screens. The guide covers entering both Long and Short Make/Model names, setting a model as 'Active,' and allowing blank models. Although the primary example is within the 'Inquire/Update Units' module, the document notes that the same procedure is applicable in the P.O.S. (Point of Sale) and Service menu options."
