## Quantum Documentation

DIS Quantum is the modern, web-based successor to the Keystone dealer management system. Built on a contemporary technology stack, Quantum delivers a full suite of dealership management tools through a browser-based interface, enabling greater flexibility and accessibility for dealership staff. It covers all core business functions, including parts management, point of sale, service management, unit inventory, customer relationship management, and financial reporting.

This section provides documentation for the Quantum platform, including user guides for key workflows, system configuration instructions, details on vendor-specific integrations (such as Kubota, JCB, Polaris, and CLAAS), and comprehensive new feature guides for each software release. The documentation is designed to support both new users learning the system and experienced users seeking reference material for specific features or configurations.
