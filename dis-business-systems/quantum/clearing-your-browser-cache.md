## Introduction

The cache is where your browser stores code and images downloaded from the Internet. The cache exists to help your Web experience run smoother. If you repeatedly visit the same site, the cache saves time and resources by recollecting the code and images from memory rather than repeatedly downloading the same information. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.

Occasionally, an error occurs with the files in your cache and the code or images do not get uploaded correctly. If this happens, your browser's cached images and cookies need to be cleared. Follow the instructions below to clear the cache on the browser that you use. You can perform these actions whenever you like. Doing it on a regular basis will increase the likelihood that the information you access is current.
