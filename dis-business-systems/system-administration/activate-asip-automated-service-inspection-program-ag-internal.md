_Activate / ASIP - Automated Service Inspection Program - AG Internal_

THIS INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR DIS INTERNAL USE ONLY 

  

 The Activate ASIP project is an integration project that we completed with Activate Company.  This project has been developed for use by CNH dealers.  ASIP allows dealers to complete inspections and create parts lists of units in the field on a mobile application.

  

 The work that was completed by the development team allowed for:

 ASIP can get the dealer’s customer and unit information.  This information is used by the ASIP application to create and complete service inspections.  On ASIP the technicians are able to create parts lists to be used.
 Created a channel for ASIP to submit the inspections to Quantum.
 Each inspection creates a separate segment on a work order.
 The segment includes all parts and notes from the Inspection.
 This reduces double entry, and errors for service departments.

 This integration requires a dealer to sign up for Service Logistics .  The dealer’s staff can use SL Go and ASIP from the same device.  Benefits of this are:

 Record time for inspections
 Record time for the work order segment when completed
 Enter service notes beyond notes that were added during the inspections.

 This integration required some on the fly changes due to dealer input.  The team took these changes and completed them well. 

  

 We think this integration has a chance to get good penetration with our CNH dealer group.
