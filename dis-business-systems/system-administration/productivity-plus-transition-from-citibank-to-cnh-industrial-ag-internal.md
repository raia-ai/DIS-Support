_Productivity Plus Transition from Citibank to CNH Industrial - AG Internal_

On 10/10 Productivity Plus (aka Gateway, CNH Credit Cards) switched from Citibank to CNH Industrial Capital for credit processing. 

  

 Dealers were told that there would be no changes to the DMS and it's working for most dealers. However a few dealers are getting the message: Call CNH Merchant Service 800-734-4537 Routed to unconfigured processor: Transaction not permitted by cardholder (restricted card) . They are also getting a reference error number: 208. 

  

 This message means that the merchant number didn't get switched over on the CNH side, the real problem is dealers need to call a different number than the one listed in the error. 

  

 Dealers need to contact CNH Industrial Capital customer service at: 

 US Customer Service: 1-800-501-5711 

 Canada Customer Service: 1-877-222-7217
