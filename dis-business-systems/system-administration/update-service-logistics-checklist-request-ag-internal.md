 Hello User, 

 Would you like to update or add to your current SL Checklists? 

 I have attached a current list of available Checklists for the SL App. 

 Please review the list and let me know of any edits you would like to make. 

 If you would like to add a NEW checklist, please add it to the far right as a new tab. 

 Thank you ,  

  

   

 Once an updated checklist is received from the dealer, go to the sync layer page and click Import Checklist . 

 Upload the excel file which is in .csv format. 

 

 Select Toggle Checklist . Unselect the old checkmarks and checkmark the newly added sheets.
