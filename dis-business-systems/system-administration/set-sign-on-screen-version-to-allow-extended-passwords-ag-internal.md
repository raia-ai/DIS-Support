Introduction 

 As of DIS_NR116, there are two additional versions of the sign-on panel and webpage available that allows the use of passwords longer than 10 characters. 

  

 To Enable Longer Passwords 

 Set the operating system value QPWDLVL to 2 or 3 . 

 The older panel/webpage displays when the operating system value QPWDLVL is set to 1.
