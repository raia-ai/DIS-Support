_Laser Forms - Adding Logos - AG Internal_

When a customer requests a new logo, the process for a response line rep is as follows: 

 Fill out the attached Additional Service Agreement – Logo form send it to the customer for their signature. 
 When the customer returns the form, a response line rep creates a Jira ticket and assigns it to Travis Janeway. The rep completes/includes the following in the Jira ticket: 

 
 The signed Additional Services form. 
 Set the ‘Label’ in the jira ticket to UXDesign . 
 The customer ID. 
 The IP address of the customers system. 
 Any details about the logo(s) to be uploaded. 
 The image codes that are available to use on the customers system. Use WRKF LOGO* to find the image codes currently in use. 

 When Travis completes the logo upload process, he assigns the Jira ticket to the rep who created the Jira ticket, and they receive an email notifying them that the ticket has been assigned to them. 
 The response line rep contacts the customer and completes the logo installation. 
 When the process is complete the rep changes the Sales Force Case Type to Billable Services .  The rep emails Ruth to let her know: 

 
 The ticket is ready for billing 
 Of any fee greater than the standard $250 charge (for example, if after the logo was uploaded the customer requested changes) 

 The rep is finished with the process at this point.  When the accounting department completes the billing process, the ticket is closed. 

 Notes on tickets that are more than the Standard $250 charge: 

 There are clauses in the Additional Services Agreement form notifying that Watermark and Color logos may require additional time, and that changes to the logo after the process has begun may also incur additional fees based on the time involved. 
 Add any additional fee information to the internal comments of the Sales Force Case.
