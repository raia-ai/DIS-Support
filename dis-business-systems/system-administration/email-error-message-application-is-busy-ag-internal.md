_Email Error Message “Application is Busy” - AG Internal_

Introduction 

 Some users may receive the message “Application is Busy” when trying to email from a menu option in Keystone. Sometimes this is a result of Outlook not running with the same permissions level as Keystone. 

  

 Solutions 

 There are two options that can potentially resolve this issue: 

 Close Outlook when trying to email from Keystone. This will resolve the issue regardless of the permission level settings. 
 Set Outlook to run as Administrator. This option will clearly slow down the search feature in Outlook but prevent the user from having to close Outlook when trying to email from Keystone.
