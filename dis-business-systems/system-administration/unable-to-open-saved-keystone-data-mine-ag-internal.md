Issue 

 User cannot open a Keystone Data Mine file (.KDM) that is saved to their computer. 

 Solution 

 Right click on the file and use the Open With option to choose the right program to open it with. This should default all .KDM files to that program in the future.  The file path for the program to use is here:
