_Scheduled Maintenance Due Report - Keystone_

Introduction 

 This is a Fleet Management Report. The Scheduled Maintenance Due option allows you to generate a report of all units that have maintenance scheduled prior to the date or hourmeter reading provided. You can use this report to assist in creating employee's schedules as well as a reminder to contact a customer, solidify a specific time for the maintenance, and ensure the location of the unit. 

  

 To Run a Scheduled Maintenance Due Report 

 Select  Scheduled Maintenance Due (Service | Service Reports | Scheduled Maintenance Due) . The Fleet Management Report - Schedule Maintenance Due screen opens. 

    

 Type a month and year in the Due By field using the MMYY format and/or a specific Hourmeter reading in the With __ Hourmeter field. 

 Select the Print Unit Service Notes check box if you would like to print service notes with the Fleet Management Report. 

 Click  OK . A message displays across the bottom of the screen stating that a Scheduled Maintenance Report has been submitted and a report is generated listing all of the units that have maintenance scheduled before the date/hour reading provided. 

 Click  Exit  to return to the main menu.
