_Encrypt an Email in Outlook – AG Internal_

Introduction 

 This article details how to set the Encryption permissions for an Outlook email. 

  

 To Set Encryption Permissions 

 Open Outlook and select New Message , click Options in the ribbon, then click Encrypt . 

 

  

 Select from the following options 

 Encrypt Only : This only encrypts the message without additional permission. (Encrypted emails can be forwarded by the receiver, but encryption can not be removed.) 
 Do Not Forward: Recipients can read the message but cannot forward, print, or copy the content. The conversation owner has full permission to their message and all replies.  (If a recipient tries to forward an email with Do Not Forward applied, they will receive an error.) 
 (Constellation Users Only) Constellation HomeBuilder Systems - Confidential: This content is proprietary information for internal users only. This content can be modified but cannot be copied or printed. 
 (Constellation Users Only) Constellation HomeBuilder Systems - Confidential View Only : This content is proprietary information for internal users only. This content cannot be modified. 

  

 If the message receiver reports any issues when trying to open an encrypted email, advise them to use the Web Browser version of their email program.
