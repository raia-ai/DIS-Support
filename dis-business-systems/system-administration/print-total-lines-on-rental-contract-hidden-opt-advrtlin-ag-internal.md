 Total Lines WILL Print 

 
 

 When the OPT is SET, the contract prints a line total for each rental line and the subtotal of all rental lines as well as the tax and final Total dollar amount as shown in the first screen shot below. 

 This can be useful for providing customers with an estimated total, but it will always show the max monthly rate. 

 When the OPT is NOT SET, the totals DO NOT print and the contract will be similar to the second screen shot below.
