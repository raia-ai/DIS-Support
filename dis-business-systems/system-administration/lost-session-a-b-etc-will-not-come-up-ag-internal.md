_Lost Session (A, B, etc.) Will Not Come Up - AG Internal_

Issue 

 The Session went down and will not come back up, even after a backup has been performed. 

  

 Solution 

 Select Devices (System | System Operator Only | Work with Configurations | Devices) . 

   

 Note : If the top of your screen does not look like the screen shot above, press Shift + F9 and change the assistance level to Intermediate. 

 In the Position To field at the top, type in the session name. i.e. DAVEHA (last letter is the session that won’t come up, so if their B session won’t come up that would be DAVEHB). 

   

 Highlight the session and click Vary Off , then click Vary On .
