If a customer wants green screen, most will not have iSeries licenses that allow them to create sessions. Instead, you can install Mocha for them. 

 Launch the setup.exe file and select yes to everything. 

 

 Insert the customer’s server IP and click OK . 

 To prevent it from coming up as a “trial” version, open Settings and the DIS license.txt file and enter that here: 

 

 License - B28928 

 That’s it. You can pin it to their task bar.
