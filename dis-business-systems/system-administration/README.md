## System Administration Documentation

This section is dedicated to internal technical documentation for DIS system administrators and support staff. The articles provide detailed guidance on managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure that supports the DIS software ecosystem, including the IBM AS/400 server environment, database management, and system-level operations.

The documentation in this section is sourced from the DIS Salesforce Knowledge Base and is classified as internal (AG-Internal). Topics covered include server backup and restore procedures, journal management, user license administration, system snapshot reporting, troubleshooting common AS/400 errors, managing EPCLOCK data areas, configuring scheduled jobs, and performing system saves. This material is intended for trained technical staff and should be used with appropriate caution, as many procedures directly affect production systems.
