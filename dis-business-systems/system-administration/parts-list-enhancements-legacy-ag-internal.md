The article attached in the Files box on the right side of the screen details how Part Lists are used as a receiver application for the CNH eParts Reference Web (CNH ePRW) application. It also details how part lists feed into POS detail, Part Availability (independent of parts catalogs), and the Correct Stock Order Scroll/Change screen, so that parts downloaded from the CNH ePRW application can be fed into those applications. This article includes all the base package changes to Part Lists and POS made to accommodate ePRW. 

 This article does not include the interface to ePRW.
