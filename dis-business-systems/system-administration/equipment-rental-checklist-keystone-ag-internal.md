_Equipment Rental Checklist - Keystone - AG Internal_

Introduction 

 Checklists are user defined and can be used for a variety of reasons, including to ensure safety procedures are completed or all parts and pieces are with the unit when it is delivered or picked up. Work with Consignment Checklists allows you to create, change, and delete checklists. Once a checklist has been created, it can be assigned to a specific unit Class. Checklists print on Delivery/Pickup tickets.
