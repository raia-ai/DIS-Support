_QRC Rental Detail Already Exists - AG Internal_

Issue 

 User gets a message about a QRC Detail already existing in a rental reservation when trying to convert to a contract. The error comes up because they used override rates. 

  

 Solution 

 Have them back out of rentals and then go back in and try again. This should clear the error and allow them to proceed.
