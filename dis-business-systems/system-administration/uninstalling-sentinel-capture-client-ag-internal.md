_Uninstalling Sentinel Capture Client - AG Internal_

Uninstalling Sentinel/Capture Client (new way to access dashboard) 

  

 Sonicwall has made changes to their websites. We will be getting requests to uninstall AV as they continue to expire. Or, even if they want to add a new pc and don’t have enough licenses until the old pc is removed. We probably have about a year before all of the subscriptions are expired. 

  

 Go here. https://captureclient.sonicwall.com/login 

  

 Notice that it’s the Capture Client website and not Mysonicwall. 

  

   

 Click on the link at the bottom that says to login with “MySonicwall”. You can use your own or the generic sonicwall@discorp.com user. 

 This will take you here. Select Tenants on the upper left column. 

  

   

 In the past we would click on the magnifying glass and search on the customer number or s/n of the SW. That doesn’t do anything anymore. See the dropdown at the top and just start typing in the top entry. This will allow you to search and access the specific customer you’re looking for. 

 See example below which is Spaulding Equipment. Click on dashboard to see Spaulding’s dashboard which is the only place you can go to uninstall a client’s AV. 

  

   

  

 Click on Protection then Devices. You will then see the list of pcs, by name. If you click the gear to the far right of them, you will have many options. Uninstall is one of them. 

  

   

 This will also let you generate an uninstall code if they want to uninstall it later. Keep in mind that each pc will have a unique uninstall code. 

 The process is the same as before. Accessing the dashboard is what had changed.
