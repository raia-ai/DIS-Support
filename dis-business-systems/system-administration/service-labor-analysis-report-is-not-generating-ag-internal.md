_Service Labor Analysis report is not generating - AG Internal_

Issue 

 The customer is running a Service Labor Analysis report and a report is not printing and there are no outstanding jobs waiting to run.

 Solution 

 This report uses Standard Jobs to pull information.

 If the customer doesn't use standard jobs there will be no information available to generate the report. 

  

 Instead, have them try the Labor Analysis report.
