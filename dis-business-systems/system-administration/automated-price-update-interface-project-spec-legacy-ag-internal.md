Project Mission Statement 

 Price books will be automatically loaded onto a dealer’s system using Interface Manager.  Only those books that are configured on the business system and the dealer has subscribed to are loaded.  The dealer also has the option to update inventory prices during the night for the vendor(s) associated with each price book. 

  

 Project Description 

 This project consists of two major components: IFS control engine, and Nightly process program.  The function of these components is outlined in the PDF attachment in the Files box on the right side of the screen.
