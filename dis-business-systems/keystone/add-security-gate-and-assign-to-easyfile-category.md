## Introduction

EasyFile is a purchasable document management system that lets you scan and store outside source documents in Keystone. These documents are easily retrieved and then viewed, printed, emailed, or faxed.

EasyFile provides you the ability to control:
- Who can add, change, and delete files.
- Who can view files within these categories: General Ledger, Marketing, Parts, Parts Orders, Payables, Receivables, Point of Sale, Rentals, Service, and Units.

These instructions cover how to add/assign a security gate to a category, then assign the gate a password. You can repeat the process for each desired EasyFile category.

## To Add Security Gate

1.  Select **Security Maintenance** from the Keystone main menu (Security | Security Maintenance). The first Security Maintenance screen opens.

short_description: "A procedural guide for adding new makes and models to the Keystone system directly from the Inquire/Update Units screen. This document details the process enabled by Release 21v1, which supports longer make and model names."
long_description: "This document provides step-by-step instructions for users of the Keystone software on how to add new vehicle or equipment makes and models. Beginning with Release 21v1, the system supports makes up to 10 characters and models up to 16 characters. While makes and models can be added via the Make/Model Table, this guide focuses on the more dynamic process of adding them 'on the fly' while entering new unit information in the Inquire/Update Units module. The instructions walk the user through selecting the Inquire/Update option, entering the new make and model information, handling system validation messages (e.g., 'Unit Make is not valid'), and using the subsequent 'Add Make' and 'Add Model' screens to define both long and short names for the new entries. The process outlined is also applicable to the P.O.S. and Service menu options."
