## Introduction

DIS Suggests that you retain your final backup of the calendar year for longer than the default of 14 days. You can only set the days to retain your backup for your NEXT backup. After that backup, the default of 14 days will be re-applied.

## Instructions

1.  Select **Work With Automated Backup Schedule** (Security | Backup & Restore Files | Work With Automated Backup Schedule) from the Keystone menu. The **Work with Automated Backup Schedules** screen opens.

    *   *Image: The "Work with Automated Backup Schedules" screen is displayed. It shows a table with columns for "File Set" and "Description". The "Change" button is circled in red.*
