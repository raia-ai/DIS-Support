## Introduction

If an open sales or work order is opened to the wrong Customer or Unit number and not realized until well into the repair, the document can easily be re-assigned. You can re-assign the document to a new address and/or change the document type, refresh the part and/or labor prices, and retain or remove discount codes.

## How to Reassign a Document

1.  With the document that you would like to re-assign open on the Invoicing-Sold To screen, click the **Reassign** button.

    *(Image: The WORK INVOICE screen for document WO76124 is shown. The 'Reassign' button is located in the bottom center of a button panel, below options like 'Save As', 'Display', and 'WO Def'.)*

2.  The **Reassign Point of Sale Document** screen opens, listing the Document # as well as the customer name and address to which it is currently assigned.

    *(Image: The 'Reassign Point of Sale Document' window appears. It shows Document #: WO76124, Current address number: DOUG01 DOUG, and a field for 'New address number:'.)*

3.  Do one of the following:
    *   Click **New address number:** and select a new address to re-assign the document to and click **Enter**.
    *   Click **Enter** to keep the document assigned to the same customer.

4.  Additional options appear at the bottom of the screen.

    *(Image: The 'Reassign Point of Sale Document' window now displays additional options below the address fields. These options include checkboxes for 'Retain document number', 'Reprice parts', 'Reprice labor', 'Retain discount codes', and an alternative button for 'New document type:'.)*

5.  Do one of the following:
    *   Select the **Retain document number** to keep the same document number.
    *   Click **New document type:** to assign the document to a new document type.

> **Note:** The following options only work if you selected the **Retain document number** check box.

6.  Select whether to reprice the parts and/or labor according to what is setup in price table maintenance for the customer and whether or not to retain discount codes by selecting or unselecting the provided check boxes:
    *   `✔ Reprice parts`
    *   `✔ Reprice labor`
    *   `✔ Retain discount codes`

7.  Click **Enter**. A message appears stating that the re-assignment was successful.

8.  Click **Enter** again. The Invoicing-Sold To screen re-opens displaying the changes to the document.
