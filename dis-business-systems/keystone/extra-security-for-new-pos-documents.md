short_description: "A guide on using the G/L Power Add and Copy feature in the Keystone system. It explains how to group multiple divisions to add or update general ledger accounts simultaneously, preventing redundant data entry."
long_description: "This document provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the 'G/L Power Add and Copy' functionality within the Keystone software by Dealer Information Systems (DIS). The feature is designed to streamline general ledger management across multiple business divisions. Users can group divisions together, allowing them to add or update a G/L account in one division and have it automatically replicated across all other divisions in the group. This guide covers the step-by-step process for grouping divisions, generating an 'Exception Report' to identify discrepancies between accounts in linked divisions, and adding or updating accounts in bulk. It details how the system intelligently prompts for associated account types (like Cost of Sales) and validates the information before committing the changes. The document includes screenshots and explanations for each stage, from initial setup in Account Maintenance to the final creation of duplicate accounts in linked divisions."
