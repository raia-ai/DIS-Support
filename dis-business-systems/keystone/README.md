## Keystone Documentation

DIS Keystone is a comprehensive dealer management system built on the IBM AS/400 platform, designed to manage all aspects of a dealership's operations. It has served as the core business system for agricultural, construction, and outdoor power equipment dealers for decades, providing robust functionality for parts management, point of sale, service, accounting, and vendor integrations.

This section contains documentation sourced from the DIS Keystone help system and internal knowledge base. The articles cover a wide range of topics, including system configuration, user guides for common workflows, reporting procedures, vendor-specific interface setups (such as Kubota, JCB, CLAAS, Polaris, and CNH), and new feature summaries for each software release. Whether you are setting up a new integration, training a new user, or troubleshooting an issue, this section provides the foundational reference material for the Keystone platform.
