## Introduction

Keystone now features a serialized Parts button in Parts Posting & Maintenance that allows you to attach a serial number to any part with a positive on-hand quantity.

## Adding Part Serial Numbers in Parts Posting & Maintenance

1.  In the **Parts Posting & Maintenance** screen, type a part number in the **Part #** field or click **Part #** and select a part from the Search Parts for Division screen. Click the **Serialized Parts** button.

    > **UI Example: Parts Posting and Maintenance**
    > In the `Part Information - Part Information` tab, after loading a part (e.g., Part #: 13-1087, Description: PUMP WATER TK376), the **Serialized Parts** button becomes accessible.

short_description: "A guide on how to configure the retention period for end-of-year cloud backups in the Keystone system. It details the process of extending the default 14-day retention for the final backup of the calendar year."
long_description: "This technical document provides step-by-step instructions for users of the Keystone system on how to set a longer retention period for their final, end-of-year cloud backup. The standard retention period is 14 days, but for archival and compliance purposes, it is often necessary to retain the year-end backup for a longer duration, such as 365 days. The guide walks the user through navigating the 'Work With Automated Backup Schedule' screen, selecting the appropriate backup file set, and modifying its retention settings. It covers locating the 'Retain next backup' option and specifying the desired number of days. This procedure is temporary and applies only to the next scheduled backup, after which the system reverts to the default 14-day retention policy. The document includes screenshots to visually guide the user through each stage of the process."
