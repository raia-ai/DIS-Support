## Introduction
The cache is where your browser stores code and images downloaded from the Internet. The cache exists to help your Web experience run smoother. If you repeatedly visit the same site, the cache saves time and resources by recollecting the code and images from memory rather than repeatedly downloading the same information. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.

Occasionally, an error occurs with the files in your cache and the code or images do not uploaded correctly. If this happens, your browser's cached images and cookies need to be cleared. Follow the instructions below to clear the cache on the browser that you use. You can perform these actions whenever you like. Doing it on a regular basis will increase the likelihood that the information you access is current.

## Google Chrome
1. Open Google Chrome and simultaneously press the **Ctrl, Shift, and Delete** keys on your keyboard. The Clear Browsing Data screen opens.

2. Select the **Cached images and files** check box. Select any other check boxes for the items you would like to delete. Click the drop-down menu and select the length of history that you would like to delete. Options range from "the past hour" to "the beginning of time."

3. Click the **Clear browsing data** button at the bottom of the screen.

## Firefox

short_description: "A guide for dealerships on using CNH Promotion Codes within the Credit Card Authorization screen in the Keystone invoicing system. It details various promo code options and their specific use cases."
long_description: "This document, created by Dealer Information Systems (DIS), provides detailed instructions for dealerships on how to apply CNH Promotion Codes in the Keystone software, specifically on the Credit Card Authorization screen during invoicing. It begins with a brief introduction outlining the document's purpose. The core of the guide is a screenshot of the 'Credit Card Authorization' window, highlighting the CNH Promo Code options. A detailed bulleted list explains each 'Promo Code Option': Lookup Promotion, Auto-Apply Promotion, Validate Promotion, Force Promotion, Use Rebate Card & CNH Card, and Use Rebate/Gift Card only. The guide clarifies the conditions for using each option, such as when to use a rebate card, how to handle partial payments, and the process for forcing a promotion with proper authorization. It also includes important notes, such as the fact that customers can only use one rebate card per transaction and that DIS cannot provide remaining balances on rebate cards."
