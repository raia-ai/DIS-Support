short_description: "A guide on converting US dollar part prices to Canadian dollars within the DIS Keystone software. It covers updating the price book with the current exchange rate and repricing parts already in inventory."
long_description: "This document provides a step-by-step procedure for users of the DIS Keystone software to convert part pricing data from a US vendor (listed in US prices) to reflect current Canadian prices. The process involves configuring vendor pricing factors, downloading the US price book, and then applying a currency exchange rate to the entire price book. The guide details how to navigate to the 'Display/Print/Change Price Book' screen, select the appropriate book, and input the exchange rate. Additionally, it outlines a separate but related procedure for repricing parts that are already in the user's inventory, ensuring that both future orders and current stock reflect the updated Canadian pricing. This second procedure involves using the 'Automatic Update from Price Book' feature and handling supersession options. The document is intended to be used each time a new price book is downloaded or whenever the currency exchange rate changes."
