## Introduction

To make viewing reports exported into Excel easier, DIS continues to create Excel templates for Report Center. These templates are stored on your business system and are automatically downloaded by DIS. Some of the reports that have templates created for them include: Aged Receivables Detail, Aged Receivables Summary, Aged Payables Detail, Aged Payables Summary, Comparative Income Statement, Financial Statement, Inventory Flooring, Labor Analysis, Sales Price Book & Trial Balance.

The instructions below detail how to export a report to an Excel Template. If a template exists for a report, the name of the report is listed on the DIS Keystone Report Center screen as shown below.

## Instructions

1.  Generate the report in Keystone.

2.  Select **Keystone Report Center** from the Keystone main menu (**System | Keystone Report Center**). The DIS Keystone Report Center screen opens displaying the reports that have been generated.

    > **UI Screenshot:** The `DIS Keystone Report Center` window is shown. A toolbar at the top includes a green "X" icon labeled "Click to Export." Below, a list of generated reports is displayed in a table with columns for File, User, Printer, Pages, Date, and Time. A red box highlights the "Aged Payables Detail" and "Aged Payables Summary" reports in the list.

long_description: "This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for administrators on how to configure and apply extra security features for new Point of Sale (P.O.S.) documents within the DIS Keystone software. The primary feature is the 'Security Gate,' which prompts for a security code when users attempt to create P.O.S. documents for designated customers, preventing unauthorized document creation. The guide details the process of setting up the master security gate, assigning it to menu options, and then applying this security to specific customer accounts through either 'Address Maintenance' or 'Receivables Maintenance'. It also explains how to configure an alternative customer address to be suggested when the initial, secured address is entered. Finally, the document illustrates the results of this setup, showing the various prompts and options users will encounter when creating new documents for a secured customer account, including the security validation process and error handling."
