## Introduction

The Direct Fill option forces all reserved parts from POS invoices to be filled directly from the order it was placed on. However, there may be times where you want to fill these reservations early. For example, if a stock order comes in and there are no receipts to reservations but there are priority orders that could be filled with these parts.

## Inquire/Update Reservations – Fill Reservations

This option shows all part lines that can be completely or partially filled with the available quantity for each part.

> **Note:** This is not a complete list of part reservations, only those that have been ordered and can be filled.

- Select **Inquire/Update Reservation Priorities** (`Parts | Stock Order | Receive Order | Inquire/Update Reservation Priorities`) from the Keystone main menu.
