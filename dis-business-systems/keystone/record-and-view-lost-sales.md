## Introduction
A customer can decide not to purchase a part for a variety of reasons such as price or immediate availability. When a customer doesn't make a purchase, you can record it in your sales history. Demand associated with lost sales is considered when calculating a Suggested Stock Order and recording lost sales will generate a more accurate Suggested Stock Order. Additionally, if lost sales are recorded, a report of lost sales by vendor or a particular customer can be created.

## Record Lost Sales
You can record lost sales using the Parts Posting and Maintenance or Invoicing menu options.

### Record in Parts Posting and Maintenance
1. Select **Parts Posting and Maintenance** from the Keystone main menu (**Parts | Parts Posting & Maintenance**). The Parts Posting and Maintenance – Transaction screen opens.

short_description: "A brief guide on how to use the 'Serialize Parts' feature in Keystone. It covers adding serial numbers to parts in Parts Posting & Maintenance, how serialized parts are identified in the system, and how to handle them during a Point of Sale transaction."
long_description: "This document provides a step-by-step technical guide for users of the Keystone software, a product of Dealer Information Systems (DIS). It details the 'Serialize Parts' feature, which allows users to attach unique serial numbers to parts with a positive on-hand quantity. The guide is broken down into three main sections: adding serial numbers through the 'Parts Posting & Maintenance' screen, identifying serialized parts within the system, and using serialized parts in Point of Sale (POS) transactions. The process involves selecting a part, using the 'Serialized Parts' button, adding serial numbers, and then selecting the appropriate serial number during invoicing. The document includes screenshots to visually guide the user through the interface. It also explains that the system prevents closing a ticket without selecting a serial number for a serialized part and shows how the serial number appears on the final POS invoice and in system reports."
