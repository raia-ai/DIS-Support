## INTRODUCTION

Part supersession is the replacement of a part with an interchangeable part. When a part is superseded to another part, a supersession chain is formed. When a supersession chain consists of multiple parts, there is a potential for backward supersession and forward supersession.

Supersession information can come from price books or be entered manually through Parts Posting & Maintenance. You can view backward and forward supersession information for a part through Parts Inquiry or while on the Document Detail screen in Invoicing.

This document covers how to manually enter part supersession information as well as how to set the system to search for backwards supersession information. It also instructs you how to view supersession information in Invoicing when it is found.

## To Manually Enter Part Supersession Information

You can manually enter parts that are superseded by another part in Parts Posting & Maintenance.

1.  Select **Parts Posting & Maintenance** (Parts | Parts Posting & Maintenance) from the Keystone main menu. The Parts Posting and Maintenance – Transaction screen opens. Click the **Information** button.

short_description: "A procedural guide for conducting a physical parts inventory using the Keystone system with the Group/Van option. It outlines steps to be completed before, during, and after the inventory count."
long_description: "This document provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for performing a physical parts inventory within the Keystone software, specifically for users subscribed to the Group/Van option. The instructions are divided into three critical phases: tasks to complete before taking inventory, actions to perform during the count, and procedures for finalizing the inventory afterward. The 'Before' section covers preparatory tasks like correcting negative on-hand quantities, verifying bin locations and part pricing, and running End of Month procedures. The 'During' section details how to generate count sheets and perform the physical count. The 'After' section explains how to adjust part quantities in the system, run exception reports to identify discrepancies, and generate final variation reports to compare pre- and post-inventory data and assess the financial impact of adjustments."
