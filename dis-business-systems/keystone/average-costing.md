## INTRODUCTION

The DIS Business System uses dealer net (replacement cost) unless average costing is installed (Security | OPT DIS Master Menu | Parts | Menu Two). When average costing is installed, the system calculates the Average Cost of each part as it is received, displays Average Cost in Parts Inquiry, and uses Average Cost instead of Dealer Net on selected reports and for automatic transactions.

short_description: "A brief guide on how to change or rename bin location numbers within the Keystone system. It outlines the process for reassigning all parts from an old bin location to a new one."
long_description: "This document provides step-by-step instructions for users of the Keystone system, a software solution by Dealer Information Systems (DIS). It details the 'Change Bin Location Number' function, which is accessed via the PFBIN command in the AS/400 interface. The guide is intended for users who need to rename existing bin locations or consolidate parts by moving them from one bin location to another. The process involves launching the AS/400 command screen, executing the PFBIN command, and then entering the current and new bin location numbers. All parts associated with the original bin location are automatically reassigned to the new one. The document also includes an important note on the specific syntax required when dealing with bin location numbers that begin with a blank space, requiring the use of single quotes."
