## Introduction

Keystone allows you to set options that require salespeople to provide a password in order to sell a part or unit below cost (Dealer Net). This document covers how to set related options, setup the passwords, process a sale below cost in Invoicing, and automatically or manually print the Sale Below Cost report.

## Set Options

There are three options related to preventing part/unit sales below cost:
- Prevent Sale Below Cost
- Sale Below Cost Report
- Prevent Sale Below Cost Conditions

### Set Prevent Sale Below Cost and Sale Below Cost Report Options

long_description: "This document provides comprehensive instructions for administrators and users of the Keystone system on how to manage sales profitability using the 'Prevent Sales Below Margin' feature. It details the process of enabling the security option, which requires a password to complete a sale if the item's price falls below a predetermined margin percentage. The guide covers setting up the initial options in the Point of Sale menu, configuring specific margin percentages for different parts (by vendor or class) and units (by make or model), and establishing the necessary override passwords. Furthermore, it walks salespeople through the process of handling a below-margin sale during invoicing, where a security gate appears, requiring a password and authorization. Finally, it explains how to automatically generate reports at the end of the day or manually run the 'Sale Below Margin Report' to review all attempts or just successful overrides, providing management with crucial oversight on discounting practices."
