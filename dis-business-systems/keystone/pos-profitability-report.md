## INTRODUCTION

The POS Profitability Report allows you to track profit margins on a ticket-by-ticket basis for all POS invoices. Various report templates can be created so that separate reports can be pulled for each department, giving you sales, cost of sales, and profit margin for each individual ticket. The report can be generated for any date range and for all salespeople or a specific salesperson, all customers or a specific customer, and all service vans or a specific service van.

## Setting up the report

If the report you would like to use already exists, skip ahead to the Running the Report section.

1.  Select **P.O.S. Profitability Report** from the Keystone main menu (`P.O.S. | P.O.S. Reports| P.O.S. Profitability Report`). The POS Profitability Report – Selection screen opens.

2.  Click the **Report Table Maint** button. The Profitability Report Tables – Selection screen opens.

short_description: "A guide on configuring and using the 'Prevent Duplicate Address Entry' feature in the Keystone/Quantum system. It covers enabling the feature, building an index, managing reserved words, configuring search fields, and using the search function when adding new customers in Point of Sale."
long_description: "This technical document provides a step-by-step guide for system administrators and users on how to activate and utilize the 'Prevent Duplicate Address Entry' feature within the DIS Keystone/Quantum software. The feature is designed to maintain data integrity by checking for existing customer records before creating new ones. The guide details the initial setup process, which includes enabling the 'Find' option in the Point of Sale menu. It then explains how to build a customer information index for searching, manage a list of 'Reserved Words' (like 'Street' or 'Avenue') to exclude from searches for better results, and configure the specific fields used for searching and displaying results. The document walks through setting search options, such as priority and criteria matching. Finally, it illustrates the end-user workflow for conducting a search when adding a new cash customer in the Point of Sale module, from entering search data to reviewing matching results and either selecting an existing customer or creating a new one."
