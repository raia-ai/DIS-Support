## Introduction

There are several procedures for configuring parts in Keystone including Parts Vendor/Class Configuration, which is covered in this document.

## Add a New Vendor to System

The first step in parts configuration is adding the parts vendor to the system so that parts can be added to inventory and specific processes such as ordering can be set up.

1.  Select Configure Vendor Class (Parts | Parts Configuration | Configure Vendor/Class) from the Keystone main menu. The Parts Vendor/Class Configuration screen opens.

2.  Type the vendor code that you would like to assign to the new vendor in the field provided and click the **Next Arrow**. The Parts Vendor/Class Configuration screen opens. If NEW does not display next to the vendor code, it means the vendor code has already been assigned - click the **Back Arrow** and enter a new code.
