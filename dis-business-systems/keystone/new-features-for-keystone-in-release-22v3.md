## Accounting

### GL Power Add and Copy
The General Ledger Power Add option allows you to group multiple divisions and add or update a general ledger account in all of those divisions from any one of the grouped divisions. This prevents you from having to enter or update the general ledger information in each division separately. Furthermore, the system now prompts for the correct type of additional accounts during setup, guiding you through the process while showing the assigned accounts and their associated information on one screen.

You can also generate a report that lists the differences in each account across grouped divisions, allowing you to quickly identify differences and sync the accounts if desired.

### Receivable Payment Batch Recovery
If your service is interrupted or your session is abruptly ended for any reason while creating a receivable's payment batch, the information is now saved and recoverable.

## Accounting/Archiving

### Check Reconciliation Reports
Check Reconciliation will now archive reports when completing the check reconciliation process. Reports will be located under the Accounting Reports option within the Work With Archived Documents menu item.
