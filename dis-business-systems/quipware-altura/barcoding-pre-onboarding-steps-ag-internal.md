_Barcoding Pre-onboarding Steps - AG Internal_

Steps to accomplish before the install and onboarding for the Barcoding project:
 Business System evaluation: 24V1 or NR86 +
 Barcoding OPT turned on (so checkbox appears in PO Receipt)
 Product Key enabled for Barcoding (X6-14)

 Altura evaluation
 Person who we will onboard has a valid Altura logon
 In Quantum: Marketing – Address Maintenance – user has valid email address

 The logged-on account is configured in the correct default division in Altura
 Licenses applied for Barcoding (so that we can view the Parts menu in Altura – Cycle Count/PO Receipt)

 Onsite – the dealership location needs WIFI for the MC3300, a connection to the internet:
 Altura/Cloud/AWS connectivity

  
 After the above has been accomplished/realized, at that point we should make the appt for an install/onboarding session with the dealer.
