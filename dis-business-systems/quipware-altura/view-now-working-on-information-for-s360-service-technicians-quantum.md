_View Now Working On Information for S360 Service Technicians - Quantum_

Introduction 

 When technicians use Service Logistics for labor punches, the Now Working On information does not display in Technician View in Quantum as this feature does not retrieve the Now Working On (NWO) information from Service Logistics. Once the first punch is completed, the only information that displays is Field in the WO# column and Tablet in the Customer column as shown below. 

 

 However, this information can be viewed in Altura as detailed in this article.

 This screen allows you to view the Schedule and Queue for technicians. Click Schedule or Queue in the upper-left corner to access service technician information and view the work order they are currently working on.
