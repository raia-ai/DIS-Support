_Excel Export Issues - QW_

Problem 

 Unable to export reports and documents using the “ Format ” of “ MS Excel 97-2000 (Data only) ” (or to any other format type – “PDF”, “Text”, etc..) to the “ Destination “ of “ Disk file ” from the QuipWare application.

  

 

  

 Symptoms 

 The Excel export window dims and hangs.

 

  

 The above window closes and generates a pop-up error window.

 

  

  

 Resolution 

 A possible reason for this could be that Microsoft Office is installed on the QuipWare application server. Microsoft Office (Outlook, Excel, Word, etc..) is not a requirement for the QuipWare application to function properly,

 and if installed, it should be uninstalled. In at least one customer’s case, it caused problems with exporting reports and documents to disk files.
