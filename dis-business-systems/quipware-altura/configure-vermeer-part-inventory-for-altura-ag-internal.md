_Configure Vermeer Part Inventory for Altura - AG Internal_

Introduction 

 Vermeer Part Inventory integration sends a nightly file from the dealer’s business system through the middle tier to Vermeer. There are three simple steps to set up a dealer, once they have purchased this service. 

   

 How does a dealer get started with Vermeer? 

 Dealers would likely get a call from a DIS Sales Rep or find out about this integration from a Vermeer representative. Once the $1000 has been acquired, DIS will go ahead and configure Altura for that dealership. 

 Navigate to Vermeer Configuration (Admin Settings | Integrations | Vermeer). 

   

 Dealer Configuration 

 Enter in the API Key and Dealer Account, taken from the official Vermeer spreadsheet. 

 

  

 Part Inventory 

 Just make this section enabled, leave the defaults, no configuration necessary. 

 

  

 Branch Map 

 These are the Vermeer codes for each location/Division. Vermeer Branch Codes are usually 5 characters, and the Account Ids are usually the same 5 characters followed by a zero 0.
