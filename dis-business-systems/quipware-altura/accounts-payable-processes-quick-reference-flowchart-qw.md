 PO Invoices Process of matching Purchase Receipts to the Supplier's invoice. Every PO should have a receipt (could have multiple) and every receipt should have an invoice (could be multiple receipts on one invoice). The PO Invoice process creates a voucher for payment on the Supplier payable account 
 Vouchers Vouchers are manually entered only when purchasing something for which there was no PO and Receipt. Examples: Utility Bills, Rent, Fees 
 AP Checks Process of paying supplier invoices (vouchers) 
 Matching Process of matching supplier invoices (vouchers) to payments or credit notes given by a supplier. When generating AP Checks, matching occurs automatically and invoices paid are printed on the remittance advice and matched in AP. However, if matching needs to be done manually (ie: to apply a credit given by a supplier to an invoice), you should match manually.
